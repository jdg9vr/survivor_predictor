Jerri Manthey has been living in Los Angeles, California, for the last six years, pursuing her acting career while bartending to help pay the bills. She credits her acting coach, Manu Tupou, with whom she has been studying with for four years, for pushing her beyond her own limitations and encouraging her to write and direct, as well. Her biggest accomplishment was a play that she and her best friend wrote, directed and produced, titled Beautiful Chaos, for the Hudson Theater in Los Angeles. Additionally, she has had roles in various independent films, commercials, and feature films, including the telefilm That Championship Season.
As Manthey puts it, she grew up an ""army brat""; her father served 28 years in the United States Army, having retired in 1997. Due to the military way of life, she moved every three to four years of her childhood, spending a total of 12 years on various Army bases in Germany. Graduating from high school in 1988 in Neu Ulm, she then attended the University of Maryland in Munich, Germany.
Manthey describes herself as adventurous, fun loving, spontaneous, honest, and kind. Her favorite hobbies include photography, cooking, painting, writing, reading, and her all-time favorite, camping.

Her favorite event is Burning Man, a festival that takes place every year in the vast, barren Black Rock desert of Nevada. She has gone for the last two years and says she will go every year for as long as she lives or until the event no longer takes place. At Burning Man 2000, she and a group of friends from all over California organized a theme camp and stayed for 12 days. They built their own shelter and brought all the supplies necessary to survive in the harsh environment and extreme weather. Manthey named their temporary residence ""Camp Chaos"" and adopted the slogan ""The Ultimate Order Lies in Chaos,"" a motto she believes applies directly to her life.
A perfect day for Manthey always begins with a cup of coffee! Then, a hike in one of the various canyons of Los Angeles, playing with her dog Gidget and her cat Kiya, writing in her journal, surfing the net, e-mailing, watching a good movie, spending time with a close friend over dinner, and curling up with a good book. Her favorite movies are The Big Lebowski and Search for the Holy Grail. Her favorite TV shows are The Sopranos and Sex and the City.

Rudy joined the Navy in April 1945 and immediately volunteered for ""secret and hazardous duty"" with the Amphibious Scouts and Raiders, highly classified naval commando units. In 1951, six years after Scout and Raider training at Fort Pierce, Florida, Rudy completed UDT (Underwater Demolition Teams) training in Little Creek, Virginia, and was assigned to UDT-2 (redesigned as UDT-21 in 1953). He remained in UDT-21 for the next 11 years. During this period, he completed numerous specialized schools and deployed routinely to the Mediterranean and Caribbean areas with the Naval Amphibious Forces. Rudy became a proficient combat swimmer and expert in small-boat operations. In 1962, Rudy was one of the 50 hand-selected officers of the original SEAL (Sea-Air-Land) Team TWO, becoming one of their most distinguished members.
In 1967, Rudy was advanced to the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer and, between combat tours, served as the senior enlisted position of Command Master Chief. From 1968-1970, Rudy completed two combat deployments to Vietnam. Among his numerous awards, Rudy earned the Bronze Star Medal for heroic action during more than 45 combat operations.

In the late 1980's, Rudy became the Naval Special Warfare Community ""Bull Frog,"" a distinguishing award presented to the SEAL serving the longest time on active duty. Instead of retiring, Rudy was selected as the Senior Enlisted Advisor to USSOCOM. In August 1988, Rudy headed to Tampa, Florida and entered into the ""inner circle"" of the Special Operations Command to advise on all enlisted matters of the Joint command. For his extraordinary performance, Rudy was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal - an award not often given to an enlisted man.

Jerri Manthey has been living in Los Angeles, California, for the last six years, pursuing her acting career while bartending to help pay the bills.

At Burning Man 2000, she and a group of friends from all over California organized a theme camp and stayed for 12 days. They built their own shelter and brought all the supplies necessary to survive in the harsh environment and extreme weather. Manthey named their temporary residence ""Camp Chaos"" and adopted the slogan ""The Ultimate Order Lies in Chaos,"" a motto she believes applies directly to her life.
A perfect day for Manthey always begins with a cup of coffee! Then, a hike in one of the various canyons of Los Angeles, playing with her dog Gidget and her cat Kiya, writing in her journal, surfing the net, e-mailing, watching a good movie, spending time with a close friend over dinner, and curling up with a good book.

Jolanda ""Jo"" Jones attended Alief Elsik High School in Houston, Texas, where she graduated magna cum laude and was an All-American in both track and field and basketball. She is the only person to win the Texas State 5A Team Championship as an individual. After high school, Jones went on to graduate magna cum laude with a degree in political science from the University of Houston. She served on numerous university and community boards and organizations and was a member of the student government. Jones was nominated by the university for a Rhodes scholarship and received the NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship. In 1995, Jones earned her Juris Doctorate from the University of Houston Law Center. She is currently self-employed as a lawyer/consultant/community activist.
Jones was the 1989 US Track and Field Heptathlon Champion and earned an unprecedented three NCAA heptathlon championships. She was the runner-up for SWC Female Athlete of the Decade for the 80s, two-time Academic All-American while at the University of Houston and a 1989 NCAA Top Six Award winner.
An abusive relationship forced Jones to retire from track and field for seven years. Despite the odds, she resumed training while working part-time as a corporate lawyer. Within three months, she had qualified for the 1996 US Olympic Trials. Unfortunately, her 19 year-old brother was murdered two weeks before she was to compete. His death and her meager five months of training proved too much to overcome (although she did win the high jump portion of the heptathlon and was in sixth place after three events). After competing in three events, she became severely dehydrated and was forced to withdraw.
Such accomplishments have earned Jones a spot in the Cougar Hall of Fame at the University of Houston Athletic/Alumni Center. She was inducted into the GTE (Verizon) Academic All-America Hall of Fame in 1999. She was inducted into the Texas Black Hall of Fame in 2003.
Jones largely credits her success to her tumultuous childhood. When she was 13 months old, her father committed suicide while she was in the room. Her mother had four more children, and Jones became their primary caretaker while their mother worked. There were times when the family went without water, electricity or heat. When Jones was a teenager, their rented house burned down due to the use of candles in place of electricity. Two of her uncles committed suicide, her aunt was murdered and various members of her family are in prison and on welfare. Jones credits her criticizing mother and supportive grandmother for teaching her to be the best and stand up for the poor and disenfranchised.
Jones' niece died of SIDS in 2000. Consequently, she sits on the board of the 501c(3) named after her niece, the U'jana Conley Foundation for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. She also sits on the board of the Land Assemblage Redevelopment Authority for the City of Houston.

Hometown: Eagle Rock, Missouri
Occupation: Wedding Videographer
Randy Bailey wants to be personally responsible for crushing the hopes and dreams of all other contestants with delusions of winning Survivor. He considers himself a ruthless bully who enjoys picking on those that were not blessed with his strength or intellect.
Randy describes himself as angry, blunt, mean and sarcastic (yet charming), and admits he's a train wreck.
Bailey declares he has no living relatives besides an older brother, from whom he hasn't heard from in years. He says he has never met a person who didn't eventually disappoint him. The only ""person"" he has ever loved was his recently deceased black Labrador mix, Johnson, with whom he lived for 13 years.
His biggest pet peeves are cell phones and overly religious people, and he says he doesn't allow either in his home or car.
Bailey's hobbies include scuba diving, marathon running and triathlons, including competing twice in the Hawaiian Ironman. Despite having competed in over 100 triathlons, he claims that he has not been off the couch in years. Instead, he now enjoys his nightly hot tub with a scotch on the rocks. He is also a private pilot, enjoys watching football and occasionally plays golf.
Bailey's primary motivation for being on the show is to be hungry, tired, dirty and smelly. He also says he needs a long vacation where he will not be hassled with the mundane issues of his boring life. He's a Survivor purist and guarantees he will win if the game is not ""poisoned"" with too many twists.
Bailey is currently single and lives on a lake in rural southwest Missouri. Randy recently moved from Plano, Texas where he lived for 20 years and still claims to be a Texan at heart. He plans on returning there after he wins the million. He has an engineering degree from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, but chooses to work as a wedding videographer where he can set his own schedule.

His birth date is March 31, 1959.[1]

Despite the adversity that Carolina has faced throughout her life, she has a positive outlook and views those difficulties as learning experiences that have pushed her to become the trash-talking firecracker and Survivor of life that she is today.
Three years ago, with only $250 in her pocket, Carolina made the move from Florida to Los Angeles to accomplish personal goals and to fulfill her desire to help provide for her family.

As the head women's soccer coach at the Southwest Baptist University in Missouri, he is called ""Coach Wade,"" but he also goes by ""Maestro"" due to role as an artistic director and conductor of a California symphony orchestra. A skilled musician, Benjamin was traveling the world playing the trumpet before most kids could even spell ""trumpet.""
Wade sees coaching as another form of manipulation. ""You have to find out what everybody wants, what everybody needs, what they think they want, what think they need and then you have to be the person that solves everything."" He knows these skills will be valuable in the game of Survivor.
If Benjamin was asked to wear just one hat, it would be that of ""Renaissance Man."" Aside from setting the world record for the longest solo kayak expedition on the ocean (an amazing 6,132 miles), Wade has also been attacked by a tiger shark, stalked by a jaguar in the Amazon and has been bitten by a piranha on his right hand. To say that he is a Type A, Alpha male, who likes to control the environment around him may just be an understatement. Coach's dominant personality will be a force to be reckoned with in the game.

Benjamin is single and currently splits his time in Bolivar, Mo, and Susanville, Calif. His birth date is September 18.[1]

Brett Clouser grew up in Salem, Oregon before coming to LA in 2004 to attend Pepperdine University. After graduating with a degree in Business Administration, Clouser first decided to go the corporate route, only to find his passions were elsewhere. Brett then pursued his dream of launching a cause based clothing company which would soon become, ""The Monument of Our Hearts."" An up-and-coming social entrepreneur, Clouser strives to leverage his brand to actively support and advocate for healthy body image.
Brett's flirtatious behavior with women could be his biggest asset in the game or it could be his biggest hindrance. ""I'm going to try and put up the best wall I can, but I feel like I'm going to be a sucker for a couple of them.""
Always a showman, Clouser loves to be in front of people and make them laugh. When he's not operating his clothing company, Brett can be found in his element, the great outdoors. Never a fan of the gym, Brett enjoys trail running and extreme outdoor activities. His charm and competitive nature will make him a dynamic player and force to be reckoned with on Survivor.

Mick Trimming (33)
Hometown: Los Angeles, Calif.
Occupation: Doctor
Smart, funny, charming and a doctor, Mick is every single woman's dream and every single man's nightmare. At 33 years old, this Idaho import is a resident anesthesiologist at UCLA who takes great pride in his intense occupation. He is highly motivated to do whatever it takes to win the million dollar prize in order to pay off the hundreds of thousands that he owes in student loans.
With all of the stress in his life, he candidly describes his perfect day being one where he is able to sleep in until 7:30 (or maybe 8:00) a.m. In addition to reading trade magazines, he enjoys the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine and the ones hidden underneath his mattress.
A man of humor, another one of Mick's pet peeves is when people cannot admit they are wrong. He also admits that the quickest way to get him angry is to throw dirt clods at him. Definitely a conversationalist, topics that are off limits to Mick are ridiculous situations that people find themselves in, and he absolutely refuses to talk about the sexual escapades of people's grandparents.
In addition to his desire to pay off student loans, he hopes to buy a vacuum cleaner with the winnings. Oddly enough, the wildest thing he would do to win would be to ""give a homeless person a tongue bath"" but he would never go as far as disabling someone … well at least not permanently.
Currently, Mick resides in Los Angeles, Calif. His birthday is May 10.[2]

Two of his most memorable adventures were traveling to Italy last spring with his father and throwing out the first pitch at the Red Sox game last Labor Day when the team hosted the Yankees at Fenway Park.
Rob was born and raised in Boston. Growing up, he was very involved in athletics, especially hockey, baseball and football.

A skilled musician, Benjamin was traveling the world playing the trumpet before most kids could even spell ""trumpet.""
Wade sees coaching as another form of manipulation. ""You have to find out what everybody wants, what everybody needs, what they think they want, what think they need and then you have to be the person that solves everything."" He knows these skills will be valuable in the game of Survivor.

Russell Hantz (36)
Hometown: Dayton, Texas
Occupation: Oil Company Owner
Russell Hantz's personality speaks for itself when he proudly displays a missing tooth that he refuses to fix! This married father of four is visually memorable. Standing tall at only 5'6"", he is built like a brick house with a bald head. At 200 pounds of pure muscle, Russell's solid figure and sharp tongue has helped him carve out a multi-million dollar business in the oil-tanking industry.
A huge Survivor fan, this self-made man built his business from scratch by working hard, speaking his mind and stepping on anyone who got in his way. Russell won't apologize for his style of game play either saying, ""I'm not going out there to make friends. I'm just not doing it. But everybody is going to think I'm their best friend, because I'm just such a lovable character.""
Russell can't wait to get in the competition and show ""these morons how it's done"" and he ""plans to play the game dirtier, smarter and more cunning than anyone can imagine."" It is those skills that have allowed him to achieve his biggest accomplishment in life and that is being able to provide for his family.

Russell is married with four children and currently resides in Dayton, Texas. His birth date is October 10.[2]

Born in the historic city of Guanajuato, Mexico, Oscar ""Ozzy"" Lusth, began his life in the house his father built for his grandmother (which still remains in the family today). A few years after he was born, his parents divorced and Lusth moved with his mother to Durham, North Carolina, where his mother eventually remarried and had two additional children. His father remained in Mexico and had two additional children as well.
Lusth moved many times in his teen years to seven U.S. States and Central America while his mother divorced and remarried for a third time (at which point, they were living in Mountain View, California) where he learned to surf. In high school, Lusth was able to attend an alternative learning program called Learning Community where he was introduced to acting and photography. After high school, he moved to Santa Barbara. He then attended two years of college at Santa Barbara City College before moving to the Los Angeles area.
Lusth is currently working as a freelance photographer and writer. He enjoys big wave surfing, skateboarding, sailing, snowboarding, wakeboarding, gymnastics and motorcycle riding. He owns land in Panama and enjoys going there to spearfish. He can dive to 30 feet and can hold his breath under water for three minutes. He is skilled at building traps, forts, shelter and surviving in the wilderness on his own. In the summer of 2005, he camped all the way from Panama to San Diego over the course of five months. Over the past year, Lusth has begun to develop a non-profit organization to build skate parks in Mexico.

Lusth currently resides in Venice, California with his German Shepherd mix, Buddha (who also accompanies him on his board while surfing). His birth date is August 23, 1981.[2]

Personal claim to fame: I won Prom Princess at my small rural high school where my graduation class was 28 students.

Name (Age): Kourtney Moon (29)
Tribe Designation: Salani​
Current Residence: Austin, Texas
Occupation: Motorcycle Repair
Personal Claim to Fame: Easy - I grew a person inside my body, squeezed him out of a tiny orifice and managed not to completely bomb at parenting (so far). He's actually the neatest person I know. Unrelated to making human beings, I would have to say honestly, maintaining my sanity through the mental and emotional torture I have endured in just the past few years.
Inspiration in Life: LIFE inspiration? I'd have to say there is no particular person. There are many individuals who have taught me valuable lessons, whether they meant to or not, and whether they had good intentions or not. People who seek to truly be altruistic are huge inspirations for me.
Hobbies: Doing just about anything with my son, motorcycles, knitting, cocktails and night time bike rides.

They appeared to be very genuine characters, knew what their attributes were and accepted their short-comings. They also seemed to maintain their sanity when things got rough.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I NEED the money and want the experience. Traveling, meeting new people, opening new doors, getting the hell out of the Austin bubble for a little while… I severely need a drastic change in my life, preferably one that won't kill me. I think I'm going to walk away from this permanently changed…but for the better.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I have great diplomatic skills and I'm a good mediator. I often see a person's positive side over the negative, which makes me very forgiving and accepting. I have no problem leading, following, or getting out of the way when appropriate.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: Because nothing in this world makes any sense whatsoever and anything really IS possible.[1]

Reason for Being on Survivor: Who wouldn't want to be on Survivor?!?!

Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'll die out there before I quit. The only way I am leaving that island is with a tag on my toe or with a snuffed torch.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I think I have a lot of attributes that will help me succeed in the game: athleticism, charisma, smarts, etc. That said, these things are also going to make me a target in the game of Survivor, so figuring out how to use these traits in a non-intimidating way will be the key to my success.[1]

At 5'11"" and 220 ""semi-solid"" pounds, this attorney spends his working hours suing companies and individuals who violate environmental laws. In addition to practicing law, Russell enjoys spending time with his wife and five-year-old daughter and watching independent films.
Growing up in Pittsburgh, Russell's father fell victim to layoffs at a local steel mill and struggled to support his family. Forced to move into Section 8 housing, his parents eventually divorced but the separation did not weaken any of his relationships, including the one he shared with his parents. Russell's hero is his dad whom he says, ""really loved his family and was a perfect example of what a husband should be to his wife, and what a dad should be to his child.""
Despite tumultuous circumstances (or as a result of), Russell has been attracted to jobs with responsibilities ranging from environmental protection, minority youth education advocacy and representation for homeless individuals. He is a dedicated father and a loving husband and describes a perfect day as spending time with his daughter and ending the day by ""talking"" privately with his wife.
A passionate man, Russell cannot stand hearing over-generalizations about specific groupings of people and avoids discussing topics relating to race and sexuality because he feels that others usually have a hard time dealing with his conversation style.
Always prepared to joke and laugh at himself, Russell is willing to go to drastic lengths for a million dollars in order to win including making a vow to cut off his dreadlocks if he wins the title of Sole Survivor.

Currently, Russell resides in Glenside, Pa. His birthday is February 17.[1]

Reason for Being on Survivor: The challenge! My life has been defined by putting myself in new and challenging situations and succeeding.

Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I consider myself 60% brain, 35% beauty and 5% brawn. While I have been able to accomplish certain athletic feats like being the only Team President to complete the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii, those feats are generally more a test of the mind than the body. The very hardest thing to accomplish is to convince your brain to keep going when your body is telling you to stop. I have been able to control my brain to maximize whatever talents I may have both on and off the field.
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? I believe Brawn has the best chance because in Survivor, any inkling of a Brain is an automatic target due to the inherent insecurity of Brawn and Beauty.[1]

Hobbies: Bodybuilding, alcohol, psychology and cinema.
Pet Peeves: Dishonesty and lack of ambition.
3 Words to Describe You: Competitive, ambitious and confident.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? One big picture of all the people closest to me in my life to prevent loneliness, one long chain email between myself and my four best friends for endless hilarity, and a naked picture of a girl I enjoy hooking up with, in case all the attractive girls get voted off early.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Win enough money to impress girls in LA; self-growth as I will be forced to deal with extreme circumstances in a way I never imagined possible.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: Being a math guy, I'm just gonna go with the odds on this one as it would be statistically unlikely for me to be the first American survivor to die on the island. With that said, I'm sure I will be completely miserable.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: Dedicated 2,000 hours in preparing for the strategic, social and physical elements of Survivor. Did everything from 50 hours of yoga, to over-analyzing every episode, to mastering slide puzzles to ready myself. I essentially devoted my entire life to preparing for this adventure for the previous 6 months.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn and Why? I'll go with the modest answer and say all three. I'll probably be one of the physically strongest, most intelligent and my mom says I'm very handsome to boot.
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn and Why? If I'm forced to stereotype, I would say either the Brains or the Beauties. Survivor is first and foremost a game of strategy, so the Brains, which are the most logically inclined, are in the best position there. But people aren't going to give you a million dollars if they don't like you, so you can't count the Beauties out.[1]

Personal Claim to Fame: Rising above all obstacles with a smile, by myself.
Inspiration in Life: Martin Luther King Jr., in a time of struggle he pushed through without violence. A positive movement and true leader.
Hobbies: Camping, recycled art projects and planning parties.
Pet Peeves: Incapable people, party poopers and when people don't tell you that you have something in your teeth.
3 Words to Describe You: Random (hilarious), powerful and tenacious.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? A picture of my loved ones for motivation, a dollar for perspective and a shot of Jack Daniels for a kick.
Reason for Being on Survivor: To win money. My daughter and I have been poor for too long.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: My brain works better under pressure, I'm athletic, a fighter and ""cut the fat"" in every situation.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have overcome major resistance and challenges by myself. I am a fighter and there's no limit to what I can do for my baby.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I own a salon so I'm around beauty all day, I'm a smart ass so that's where I'm considered a brain, and I'm feisty and strong so ultimately, I think I'm a Brawn.
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? Challenges go to Brawns. Beauties are better at the social game. Ultimately, it's a social game, not a physical competition, so unless someone is a master manipulator on the Brawn tribe or is a socio-path, a Brawn will win.[1]

Personal Claim to Fame: Studying abroad in Ireland and visiting eight different countries while I was there. It made me more independent, adventurous and responsible.

3 Words to Describe You: Funny, flirty and smart.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? More than one bikini—I like to change it up; hair ties—I have a lot of hair and need to put it up for challenges, and a blanket.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Hopefully Parvati, because she combined sex appeal with strategy and intelligence.
Reason for Being on Survivor: My dad! He loves the show so much and would kill to be on it. I'm playing for both of us.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: My strongest asset is my background in psychology. I have studied and experimented with group dynamics and understand how to play a specific role in a group. I will also use sex appeal and flirting as a means of disguising my intelligence.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have always been aware of my role in a group and know how to lead in a sneaky way. I will use my education and flirty personality to assure I'm always in a good position.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I would consider myself a brain! I work my butt off at Northwestern and consider this an accomplishment that defines me.
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? I would say beauties for the mere fact that they possess the least threatening label. No one would expect a beauty to be a challenge threat or a strategic player, so they enter the game with the smallest target on their back.[1]

Pet Peeves: I hate when I can hear people chew their food, when people leave me voicemails (I'll call you back if I don't answer) and stupid people.
3 Words to Describe You: Witty, competitive and athletic.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? A Bible - I've always wanted to read the entire Bible. I'm a slow reader, so I would be entertained for quite a while; a toothbrush; and a Surf board - Why not? I'm easily entertained, I don't need much.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: I'm one of a kind. If I had to pick I'd say Malcolm. He's nice, but very strategic and tasteful about it.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I am never satisfied with what I've done. I always add things to my plate. The challenge, experience and opportunity would be gratifying. Second reason: Duh, the money.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm from the Midwest, cornfed! I'm a hard worker. I don't give up. I motivate people. I learn quickly and I am a master manipulator.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have the brains and skills to dominate this game. I'm very strategic and determined. I interview people on a daily basis and get confessions. I will destroy this game.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I would consider myself Brain and Brawn. I think I will do very well on the puzzles and dominate the physical challenges.

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? I think a combination of all three characteristics would produce a winning Survivor.[1]

Inspiration in Life: My dad is my hero because he has worked so hard and sacrificed so much in his life to make mine the best it could possibly be. He is the funniest and most handsome man I know.
Hobbies: Interior design, working out and dancing.
Pet Peeves: Slow drivers, guys leaving the toilet seat up, when people fish for compliments, terrible pickup lines.
3 Words to Describe You: Mature, determined and attractive.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? A razor because hairy legs are not cute, a camera to document my adventure, and my iPhone so I can Instagram and Facebook when I am bored.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: I think I can relate most to Parvati Shallow because she is beautiful and manipulative just like me. She has the ability to make everyone love her but also fear her. That power and confidence is a good quality to have for this show. I can also relate to Natalie Tenerelli because she was a young contestant and also a dancer.
Reason for Being on Survivor: The chance to experience a once in a lifetime journey and to show everyone that just because I have huge boobs and a pretty face does not mean I am dumb, it just means I look better when I am winning.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I have great leadership skills when working in a group. I also am quite handy when it comes to building things such as shelter. I am the daughter of a contractor, so he taught me well.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I could be the final Survivor because when I want something I get it. I do whatever it takes to get it. I am ambitious and very adaptive. I am never afraid to manipulate and back stab people when it puts me ahead. These qualities will be essential to me being the final Survivor.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I consider myself all three but if I have to pick, I would pick Beauty. Who wouldn't want to be beautiful? When you are beautiful you get what you want and I like getting what I want.
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? Most people would assume the Brain and Brawn would have the best chance but I think Beauty actually has the best chance. Usually if you are beautiful you have a great body which is ""brawn."" Also, most people who are beautiful have a stereotype of being dumb. Beauties could fly under the radar as a non-threat because they are stereotypically dumb and weak. I'm rooting for the beauties.[1]

Reason for Being on Survivor: The challenging adventure and the money.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: My puzzle skills, athletic ability, my wittiness and logical thinking.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: My athleticism will carry me through the early stages, my charm through the middle, and smarts to play through to the end.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I'd consider myself a Brawn. I'm a down-to-earth, rugged guy who is not afraid to get his hands dirty. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and brains seem to be smarts lacking the physical abilities. You can be brawny and good-looking and we have a brain.
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? Brawn have the best chance. Perception is they are big, competitive athletes lacking the mental fortitude to go on. After dominating early physical challenges they present little mental risk for further advance in the game. Egos left aside, they have the best chance to win the game.[2]

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: JT, because he is nice ol' country boy who everybody loved, and Malcolm, because he is strong at challenges and very likeable.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I want to prove to the world that a country boy can survive and win the million dollars.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I know how to build, fish, hunt, build a fire, and am very strong at challenges.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I will be very strong at challenges, able to win individual immunity, easily make alliances and never give up.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I figured Brawn. I'm not the smartest or prettiest guy.
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? Honestly any tribe could win. If a Brain, they know how to talk and how to present the game in different ways to change people's thoughts and decisions. If a Beauty, looks and flirting sometimes goes a long way. Most of the time a girl can change a guy's mind easy with looks and flirting. If a Brawn, being strong and winning most challenges can put you in the final three easy!! My answer would be any tribe. It is just who is coming to really wanting to win the million.[1]

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Chelsea Meissner as far as being a country girl and Kim Spradlin when it comes to being ballsy with big moves.
Reason for Being on Survivor: The million dollar prize—I'm a broke college girl who is tired of eating Ramen noodles and wants to pay off my student loans and to open up a drug rehab with my dad. Also, to prove that pageant girls aren't just cute faces, we are also smart.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm in shape and can last in challenges.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: In my 22 years of life, I have already survived cervical cancer, losing everything financially, the disease of addiction and more. It takes a fighter to survive this world and that's what I am.

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? I think to win the game of Survivor, you have to have a combination of all three.

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: I relate to Danni Boatwright. She played a true and honest game. She crushed the challenges and her social skills were top notch.
Reason for Being on Survivor: From the birth of Survivor, everyone has told me I would be the best survivor Survivor ever had. I have diligently put tapes in when I thought the tape was the right time, and I believe years of manifesting and believing in myself and my girls at ages they are at, that this was the time to prove to not only myself but all the thousands of people I know DREAMS COME TRUE! Trick is you have to make them happen and never lose sight of your dreams. Dream Big!!
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I am a great team player, a very hard worker, a very positive thinker and an incredible people person. I get along instantly with most people. I am not a control freak and I go with the flow.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: My greatest strength is my intuition and my people skills. I am a chameleon with people and have an ability to read people and situations with great strength. On top of that, I have a lot of charisma and positive energy, and I am likeable, incredibly agile and a good athlete.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I would consider myself a Brawn. I was raised in a home with four very tough brothers who were all incredible hockey players. They used to put me in goal and take slap shots off me from about two feet away when I was in kindergarten. Needless to say, they taught me well. I grew up athletic, tough and confident in the defense of myself and others. My life has been very difficult with many ugly and unpredictable obstacles and I made a conscious choice to never give up on myself or my dreams. I believe it is my God given tenacity and spirit that I was born with that gives me the title: Brawn. As my brother Mark always said so well, I am a TOUGHY TIGER!!
Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? I think that the Brawns will win without question as long as they do not allow their egos to take over. I think common sense in the game of Survivor is essential and often times really smart people lack that. I also think it is one thing to be able to build a spaceship and whole different story when it comes to building a shelter and toughing it out in the woods. Beauty is just beauty. How do you build shelter, fires and boil your own water on your looks? I think a Brawn will win.[2]

He has accumulated enormous wealth in starting several successful business ventures and constitutes the perfect embodiment of capitalism.
Hobbies: Chess, ultimate frisbee and partying.
Pet Peeves: People who are stupid but still voice their opinions, incompetent leaders, those who don't respect intelligence and those who expect handouts in life.
3 Words to Describe You: Brilliant, competitive and arrogant.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? A chess board – with a chess board present, I know I have the ability to impress whoever I'm with. Regular practice is also important. The American Flag – perhaps my biggest source of pride is being an American; and The Economist – This is my preferred news source (despite the fact that it's perceived as ""snobbish"").
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: The cleverness and strategic planning of Stephen, but the personality of Marty. Like Marty, I am a natural leader and can come off as pompous or bombastic. Also, I shared Marty's disdain for Jane on S21.
Reason for Being on Survivor: The competition. I'm insanely competitive in chess, pursuing a career in investment banking, and everything I do. I want to play the game of Survivor for the challenge, the competition and the chance to prove myself in such an epic game, under such trying circumstances. Also, the money. The expected value of playing Survivor is, monetarily alone, worth more than most peoples' salaries. I love $1,000,000 almost as much as winning.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm a strong leader despite my young age, and have worked well in a team in a number of different academic, athletic and chess-related capacities. I'm also extremely competitive and would be a large asset to a tribe in puzzles and endurance-related challenges, as well as strategic competitions.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I'm the chess expert who can plan my victory 10 moves in advance. I can use economic game theory to know the incentives of those around me. I'm the only guy who has these skills and is still personable enough to win. Think of me as a John Cochran who doesn't suck.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? A Brain, in both life and Survivor super fandom. I've seen every episode. I know the game inside and out. I'll know what I'm doing in camp life; I could probably even build a shelter just using rocks. When my body is withered and I'm left with only my t-shirt and tighty whities, I won't be a little boy out there. I'll rely on my mind.

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? What type of person excels in Survivor? The person who pushes the game forward strategically - the Rob Cesternino, Yul Kwon or Todd Herzog. A Parvati or Ozzy may slip through the cracks, but this is a brain game.[2]

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I like to win and always do! Plus, I'm lucky and can finagle my way out of situations.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? We all know I'm not here because of how I look in a bikini. I have a tendency to think I'm smarter than a lot of people, but don't we all? I guess not or you wouldn't be asking the question. There you have it - those are the analytical skills that prove I must be a Brain!

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? I'm guessing Brains because I plan to win while not caring how I look and quite possibly sucking at challenges.[1]

Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I have both the physical and social game to make it to the end. More importantly, I think it's my instincts and ability to adapt to my surroundings that will allow me to ""survive"" in this game.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: This game was made for me! I'm smart and can play a great social game. People tend to like me. I'm fast and agile. I'll do great in obstacle course challenges. I have undeniable focus and concentration and I'll smash the competition in balancing challenges. I can swim well and climb coconut trees. I am Survivor!
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? I guess I could fall under any of those categories. If I had to choose one I would have to say Brawn cause of my Martial Arts Background.

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? That's a tough question... I would say you want to possess all those qualities in order to win Survivor. If I had to choose one, I would say Brawn because as sports athletes they understand pressure situations of competition (composure). They have the where with all of team play, and with the structure of the game of Survivor in order to advance in the game you need the help of your teammates (supportive). Brain's would fail because of their know-it-all attitudes (conflicting). The Beauties would fail because they will sit back and expect everything to be handed to them.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Versatile, clever and competitive.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? Cigarettes, coffee and liquor. I don't smoke or drink coffee or liquor, but I would love to bring those items with me just so that I can barter with my tribemates! You know at some point in the game they would even give up immunity just to have a little taste of these items.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Russell Hantz, because I can be just as devious. Boston Rob, because I can be just as slick.
Reason for Being on Survivor: My main reason: The MILLION DOLLARS of course. There's no way I would be going out there for half that prize! Secondly, I'm a huge fan of the show and I would love to give the fans a great season to be remembered.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have been a street cop for 12 years. My experiences as a cop give me a huge advantage going into this game. Being outside my element is my forte. That's what I do for a living. What's going to be normal for me will be very stressful for the average castaway.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? Sounds like a trick question. Well let's see. I'm a beautiful person that has a sharp brain and strong muscles. Based on appearance, I would consider myself ""Brawn."" For the purposes of Survivor though, I would consider myself ""Brains."" Maybe I wasn't the smartest in school, but I was always the sharpest!!!

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? Survivor is definitely a game of all-around strategy. Brawn and beauty can fight over silver, but Brains would surely bring home the gold![1]

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: All my life I have been faced with everything possible; weather, breakdowns, etc. My family and I can usually find a way to improvise a way to survive and still be able to achieve my goals.
What Does It Mean to You to Play Survivor with Your Loved One? To be given the opportunity to play this game with my daughter is almost indescribable. I am looking forward to being able to watch her in settings that I may not get to see again and hopefully watch her excel in them.

I think we will build a deeper and stronger bond together after playing Survivor.[2]

Relationship to Significant Castaway: Baylor's mother
Current Residence: Dallas, Texas
Occupation: Owner of a Competitive Cheerleading Gym
Personal Claim to Fame: My business is a HUGE accomplishment. I was never a cheerleader, never had taken out a loan before 1998 when I opened the doors and certainly had no idea what it would take to be ""on"" 24x7 with really no ""off"" hours. I have a new respect for restaurant owners because my business takes blood, sweat and tears just like that profession.
Inspiration in Life: My parents for sticking together when the rest of the world didn't and for teaching me humility, determination and generosity and supporting me through thick and thin.
Hobbies: Water skiing, singing and video editing.
Pet Peeves: People who conform to a standard without knowing the facts, people who play the victim, snoring, poor hygiene, bad teeth, infidelity, valet parking in the Highland Park village.
3 Words to Describe You: Determined, compassionate and confident.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? 1) Tweezers for eyebrows and facial hair. 2) A journal to remember…moment by moment. 3) Vitamin C it's the only supplement worth taking.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Experience a once in a lifetime opportunity with Baylor and to win the million dollars!
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'll bring compassion, determination, leadership, respect, athleticism, sense of humor, the ability to dispute resolution and analyzation.
What Does It Mean to You to Play Survivor with Your Loved One? Playing the game with Baylor whether we are on the same tribe or not will be an unforgettable experience due to our duo determination, competitive edge and ability to never give up. We are a dynamic duo and have a lasting positive effect on people who we come in contact with. Together, we can accomplish anything and usually succeed at any challenge set in front of us.[2]

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Jefra.
Reason for Being on Survivor: To challenge myself socially, mentally and physically. Also, to win the million dollars to be able to adopt and have a surrogate to start a family.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I am a survivor in my everyday life because I was diagnosed with a life altering syndrome at 16 and didn't let it destroy me. Being told I wasn't ""normal"" and could never have kids was the last thing I wanted to hear at that age. I've learned to try and turn every negative into a positive and that life will always throw hard things at you, but it's how you handle those obstacles that matter the most. This game is tough. It's challenging mentally, socially and physically and I know that I can overcome anything is thrown at me no matter how bad it hurts and no matter how many times I break down just because I have in my life.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I will never give up. No matter what happens in the game, there are always loopholes and opportunities to change the way things are going. After my diagnosis, I realized that life may not always deal you a good hand, but it's how you play the hand that can change it around.
What Does It Mean to You to Play Survivor with Your Loved One? Jon and I get to experience something that only three or four couples ever have. Blood vs. Water seems to be so much harder than playing as an individual because we have to learn how to maneuver through this social and physical game together. Our sole purpose of being on this show is to challenge ourselves, but to also win to start a family by adoption or surrogacy.[1]

Occupation: Jewelry Designer
Personal Claim to Fame: I am most proud of winning a state championship for basketball my senior year of high school. In college, I played indoor volleyball at Northern Arizona University. After four years of being self-coached and self-funded, we upset the number one team in the nation in the finals of a Vegas tournament.
Inspiration in Life: My Dad. My whole life, he was incredibly hard on me and always pushing me to become better at everything I did. He grew up very poor and in a large family in which he endured a lot of hardships. Through the pain and sadness of divorce, family tragedies and death of loved ones, he was still able to keep faith and carry on. He has been an amazing father and role model to me and my sisters and he is a loyal hardworking husband who puts others before himself. I've always looked up to him and I hope that I can be as strong, loving and fearless as he is when I become a husband and father.
Hobbies: I enjoy anything that allows me to work with my hands. These include metalworking, painting, drawing and welding. I also love the outdoors- you name it: Hiking, climbing, hunting, camping, etc.

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: There are so many players that I relate to in different ways. In terms of game play, I would have to say it's a combination of Malcolm and Ozzy.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Ever since I can remember I have wanted to be on Survivor. My primary motivation is that every day I dream about competing and earning the title of Sole Survivor. With every season, my desire to play has grown more and more. The game is a true test of self-awareness as well as mental, physical and emotional determination. There is also a perk of a million dollars. I would honestly play Survivor for way less but the fact that it is one million dollars makes it that much sweeter.
Why You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I would be an asset to the tribe because I am athletic and very competitive. I love competition and I hate losing. I am not lazy and I don't mind doing what needs to get done in order to help others. I feel that I'm in decent physical shape, but I will work hard and will bust my butt in challenges and around camp. I have worked in different jobs that have focused on customer service and have dealt with a wide range of diversity in the workplace. This has taught me how to communicate and connect with people I don't know. I'm a very social person and I enjoy getting to know people and their story. Being one of the most important aspects of Survivor, I feel my social game will be strong and lead to my success in the game.

Why Will You Be the Sole Survivor: With every season I watch, I can't help but imagine that I'm actually in the game playing. My brain goes into game/strategy mode as I put myself in the shoes of the current contestants and analyze how I would deal with the conflicts each is faced with. Of course, it's different when you're sitting at home on the couch and know what every player is thinking. However, I feel that I am well rounded enough, athletic enough and mentally strong enough to adapt to the people I'm put with. I am confident in the life skills I possess and I feel I can maintain my focus despite all of the other personal and crazy things the game may and will throw my way. After being such a huge fan for so many years, I truly respect how complex and challenging the game is. I am ready to battle and I want my shot in the ultimate arena that is Survivor.[1]

Why Will You Be the Sole Survivor: I've seen every season. I know how to win and I know what strategies work and for how long/when in the game they are best to start using. Also, I'm mean enough to make it to the end but likeable enough to still get the jury's votes. Plus, I can BS my way through just about any situation.[2]

Monica Padilla (25)
Hometown: San Diego, Calif.
Occupation: Law Student
Monica Padilla is the first in her family to not only complete her undergraduate degree but also obtain a Juris Doctor. Recently, she graduated from the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, where she perfected, what she describes as, her power of persuasion. She fully intends to use her beauty and the fact that she ""can sell ice cubes to an Eskimo"" to her advantage in the game.
Exotic looks, in addition to intellect, have landed her a wide range of jobs, such as a clerk position at a well-known investment firm, as well as a position playing a theme park Pocahontas. With the keen ability to change from bookworm to party girl in a matter of moments, she is sure she will be able to adapt to anything she comes across on the island. She says that while in the Samoan wilderness, she will miss partying, clubbing and lunch with friends the most, which was exactly what she did in her free time even as she was in the home-stretch of obtaining her degree.
Much like Parvati and Amanda (from Survivor: Micronesia), she plans to be as ""sweet as pie,"" while subtly using the ""flirt card,"" in order to come off as endearing rather than overbearing. In addition to killing her fellow castaways with kindness, she has every intention of pulling her own weight around camp while studying their words and actions meticulously to ""learn about her enemies before she chooses her weapon."" Confident that she can win the title of Sole Survivor, Monica plans to buy a designer purse as her first selfish purchase.

Monica resides in San Diego, Calif. and her birthday is July 14.[1]

In 1982, he was ordered to the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier as a Ship's Officer in the Weapons Department, where he handled ship's defense systems.

If I had to choose one, I would say Brawn because as sports athletes they understand pressure situations of competition (composure). They have the where with all of team play, and with the structure of the game of Survivor in order to advance in the game you need the help of your teammates (supportive). Brain's would fail because of their know-it-all attitudes (conflicting). The Beauties would fail because they will sit back and expect everything to be handed to them.[2]

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Laura Morett because she taught me everything I know and also we have the same competitive nature.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I want to beat my mom. I love her but you have to have tough skin in my family and my mom needs to be shown the real Survivor in our family.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I am a little cute girl who gets along with everyone and lifts people's moods on the surface, but in my mind, I am 10 steps ahead of you calculating your death in this game. I'll tell you whatever it is you want to hear and lie to your face and you wouldn't even see me coming because I'm so sweet and adorable.

Stephen Fishbach (29)
Hometown: New York, N.Y.
Occupation: Corporate Consultant
Stephen Fishbach believes he's a cutthroat player who can manipulate his way to Survivor success, though you couldn't tell that by looking at his non-threatening appearance. The first one to tell you he resembles a Muppet, Stephen plans to sidetrack his competition with his goofy charm and quirky sense of humor.
Aided by his quick wit and prankster personality, this Internet marketing director could very well be a major player behind the scenes. A Yale graduate, Stephen certainly has the right mix of brains and charisma to disarm his fellow castaways. This New Yorker believes people will be inclined to trust him but claims ""that would be their mistake, because then I strike!""
Described by his friends as wild, smart and ambitious, Stephen's biggest pet peeve is when somebody is ""overconfident or cocky."" He plans to use that type of person to his advantage by forming a bond and then subtly prompting them to carry out his decisions. A strategist, Stephen prides himself on being able to pretend to agree with someone's idea while replacing it with his own.
In his free time, Stephen keeps himself active and fit by boxing and lifting weights. He also takes part in urban combat activities, namely the Idiotarod, which he describes as a great event where ""five idiots drag a shopping cart from Brooklyn to Manhattan."" Among his reasons for why he believes he will excel at Survivor, Stephen lists ""he's strategic and devious.""

Stephen is single and currently resides in New York, N.Y. His birth date is January 24.[1]

Name (Age): Joe Anglim, 25
Tribe Designation: No Collar (Nagarote)
Current Residence: Scottsdale, Ariz.
Occupation: Jewelry Designer
Personal Claim to Fame: I am most proud of winning a state championship for basketball my senior year of high school. In college, I played indoor volleyball at Northern Arizona University. After four years of being self-coached and self-funded, we upset the number one team in the nation in the finals of a Vegas tournament.
Inspiration in Life: My Dad. My whole life, he was incredibly hard on me and always pushing me to become better at everything I did. He grew up very poor and in a large family in which he endured a lot of hardships. Through the pain and sadness of divorce, family tragedies and death of loved ones, he was still able to keep faith and carry on. He has been an amazing father and role model to me and my sisters and he is a loyal hardworking husband who puts others before himself. I've always looked up to him and I hope that I can be as strong, loving and fearless as he is when I become a husband and father.
Hobbies: I enjoy anything that allows me to work with my hands. These include metalworking, painting, drawing and welding. I also love the outdoors- you name it: Hiking, climbing, hunting, camping, etc.
What is your favorite sport? It's a true tie between basketball and volleyball. I love hoops but the last several years I've been playing a lot of sand volleyball which I love playing down here in the valley of the sun.
Pet Peeves: Bad hygiene, rude, inconsiderate people, that person with really nasty coffee breath who has no idea what personal space is, when the last person to use the bathroom doesn't replace the empty toilet paper roll and when someone is telling a story and every other word is ""like.""
3 Words to Describe You: Creative, compassionate and charismatic.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? 1. A fully stocked self-replenishing ice-chest. 2. A toothbrush since I hate the feeling of my teeth being grimy. 3. Loaded up iPod because I love listening to music.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: There are so many players that I relate to in different ways. In terms of game play, I would have to say it's a combination of Malcolm and Ozzy.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Ever since I can remember I have wanted to be on Survivor. My primary motivation is that every day I dream about competing and earning the title of Sole Survivor. With every season, my desire to play has grown more and more. The game is a true test of self-awareness as well as mental, physical and emotional determination. There is also a perk of a million dollars. I would honestly play Survivor for way less but the fact that it is one million dollars makes it that much sweeter.
Why You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I would be an asset to the tribe because I am athletic and very competitive. I love competition and I hate losing. I am not lazy and I don't mind doing what needs to get done in order to help others. I feel that I'm in decent physical shape, but I will work hard and will bust my butt in challenges and around camp. I have worked in different jobs that have focused on customer service and have dealt with a wide range of diversity in the workplace. This has taught me how to communicate and connect with people I don't know. I'm a very social person and I enjoy getting to know people and their story. Being one of the most important aspects of Survivor, I feel my social game will be strong and lead to my success in the game.

Why Will You Be the Sole Survivor: With every season I watch, I can't help but imagine that I'm actually in the game playing. My brain goes into game/strategy mode as I put myself in the shoes of the current contestants and analyze how I would deal with the conflicts each is faced with. Of course, it's different when you're sitting at home on the couch and know what every player is thinking. However, I feel that I am well rounded enough, athletic enough and mentally strong enough to adapt to the people I'm put with. I am confident in the life skills I possess and I feel I can maintain my focus despite all of the other personal and crazy things the game may and will throw my way. After being such a huge fan for so many years, I truly respect how complex and challenging the game is. I am ready to battle and I want my shot in the ultimate arena that is Survivor.[1]

Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I grew up on a farm so I've seen and done it all. I've fed cows, cleaned up poop, driven a tractor, hauled fire wood and the list goes on. I'm also very competitive and would never give up in a challenge.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I'm competitive and I'll never back down. I'll always keep trying to move to the next step and I'm not afraid to fib a little or hurt people to be at the top. Everything I've ever tried to do in life I've succeeded so I know I can do this too.

He has accumulated enormous wealth in starting several successful business ventures and constitutes the perfect embodiment of capitalism.
Hobbies: Chess, ultimate frisbee and partying.
Pet Peeves: People who are stupid but still voice their opinions, incompetent leaders, those who don't respect intelligence and those who expect handouts in life.
3 Words to Describe You: Brilliant, competitive and arrogant.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? A chess board – with a chess board present, I know I have the ability to impress whoever I'm with. Regular practice is also important. The American Flag – perhaps my biggest source of pride is being an American; and The Economist – This is my preferred news source (despite the fact that it's perceived as ""snobbish"").
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: The cleverness and strategic planning of Stephen, but the personality of Marty. Like Marty, I am a natural leader and can come off as pompous or bombastic. Also, I shared Marty's disdain for Jane on S21.
Reason for Being on Survivor: The competition. I'm insanely competitive in chess, pursuing a career in investment banking, and everything I do. I want to play the game of Survivor for the challenge, the competition and the chance to prove myself in such an epic game, under such trying circumstances. Also, the money. The expected value of playing Survivor is, monetarily alone, worth more than most peoples' salaries. I love $1,000,000 almost as much as winning.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm a strong leader despite my young age, and have worked well in a team in a number of different academic, athletic and chess-related capacities. I'm also extremely competitive and would be a large asset to a tribe in puzzles and endurance-related challenges, as well as strategic competitions.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I'm the chess expert who can plan my victory 10 moves in advance. I can use economic game theory to know the incentives of those around me. I'm the only guy who has these skills and is still personable enough to win. Think of me as a John Cochran who doesn't suck.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? A Brain, in both life and Survivor super fandom. I've seen every episode. I know the game inside and out. I'll know what I'm doing in camp life; I could probably even build a shelter just using rocks. When my body is withered and I'm left with only my t-shirt and tighty whities, I won't be a little boy out there. I'll rely on my mind.

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? What type of person excels in Survivor? The person who pushes the game forward strategically - the Rob Cesternino, Yul Kwon or Todd Herzog. A Parvati or Ozzy may slip through the cracks, but this is a brain game.[2]

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn?

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Kim Spradlin. She had strategy: making as many friends as possible, having alliances and sub-alliances. She was just ""herself,"" which is exactly how I play everyday life. I earn respect, like Kim, by telling you how it is. I'm practical but also love the excitement of making big moves.
Reason for Being on Survivor: This once in a lifetime chance is filled with challenges and adventure. I want to live 100 years, not 1 year 100 times over. I want Tree Mail instead of email. I like playing games, getting my hands dirty, causing trouble and getting away with it! Also, for the money. I'm ready to adopt children and start a family.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I have construction knowledge, love to cook and play games, I am fun to be around, never quit, can fast for days and I am a hard worker!
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: Winning Survivor takes practice- practice surviving. I've been through hell and back many times. Not saying I never get scared, but I just never let fear stop me. I will be the final survivor because I have prepared physically, mentally and socially! Winning doesn't take beauty, brains or brawn- it takes heart![2]

Reason for Being on Survivor: I am a huge fan of Survivor and I have studied it for a long time. I'm clever enough to play this game well and win. My biggest inspiration to win is my mother. She is currently unemployed and I am supporting her so winning that money would help me buy a house for her.

/wiki/Neal_Gottlieb,Neal Gottlieb,Survivor: Kaôh Rōng,"February 3, 1977 (1977-02-03) (age 47)[1]","Sausalito, California",Ice Cream Entrepreneur,"
Name (Age): Neal Gottlieb (38)
Tribe Designation: Brains
Current Residence: Sausalito, Calif.
Occupation: Ice Cream Entrepreneur
Personal Claim to Fame: I started Three Twins Ice Cream with my life's savings of $70,000 in 2005 at age 28 after returning from the Peace Corps. I couldn't afford employees, so I did everything myself at first. I opened another shop, then another and then built a factory in 2010 to start selling pints to grocery stores, and have since opened a second factory. We're now sold in grocery stores in all 50 states, have a team of around 100 and sales this year that will be about 100 times sales from the first year, despite almost going broke during the economic downturn and unrelenting competition. I am proud of the growth, taking on the challenges, being creative, treating employees well, giving a great deal back and inspiring others through my version of the American dream.
Inspiration in Life: I am not much for heroes, but the person who has come closest to obtaining hero status is my Uncle Larry. I admire him for the deep and devoted love that he had for my aunt. Despite being a tough guy, he has never been afraid to cry or share his feelings. I admire him for his larger-than-life deeds, like finding 55 pounds of cocaine off the coast of Florida (he's a former cop and turned it in). I admired him because of his Popeye-like muscle on his forearm, which I later found out is actually a tumor, but I didn't know that as a kid. But more than anything, I have always admired him for being himself.
Hobbies: Traveling, indoor rock climbing and one-upmanship.
Pet Peeves: I am not really one to complain and therefore don't have too many pet peeves but I do have very little patience for whiny people and hypocritical bible thumpers.
3 Words to Describe You: Incorrigible, witty and kind.
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? I would take a big comfortable bed with high thread count sheets, a down comforter and lush pillows to facilitate good nights' sleep and an assortment of fake Immunity Idols and fake printed clues on convincing paper to fool my fellow contestants into thinking that they have immunity. Lastly, a spy kit so that I can bug camp and listen in on the plotting and scheming of my campmates to give me valuable information.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: I relate to Erik Reichenbach as my brother in ice cream. I can relate to Rob Mariano because he not only won but he seemed to have more fun than anyone else while doing so. I can relate to Tyson for his priceless, witty commentary on the other players. I relate to Parvati because I think that I'll also charm my fellow competitors while I'm busy destroying them. I kind of hate myself for saying this, but I relate to Russell Hantz for his lack of fear and filter.
Reason for Being on Survivor: My primary reason is to win, as is my secondary reason. Winning the money will be amazing but I am more interested in the metaphorical crown, bragging rights and satisfaction that comes with winning than the cash. It is also to have the privilege to compete in what I consider one of the greatest competitions of all. I have watched the show for years and yearn for the chance to be a castaway in a remote locale and compete for 39 days.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I will be the provider for the group and the court jester. I will be a calming force and the one that psyches up the tribe to go into battle. I am a strong swimmer and will be a valuable hunter, fisher and gatherer for the group. I have a tireless work ethic and will contribute more than my fair share towards building a strong shelter, cooking and getting water. I am most often happy, quite witty, never complain and am generally entertaining, which will help to keep the peace during tough and stressful times. I am physically and mentally strong, I was a competitive athlete for years, I am a fast runner and sharp, so I will be strong in challenges.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have been a Survivor fan for years and therefore understand the game, am mentally tough, a physical force, likable and absolutely determined to win. I will excel at both the social and physical game. Much of my life has prepared me to be a great contestant. Being a fan has shown me some brilliant moves and perhaps more importantly, stupid ones to avoid. More than anything, I believe that I will be the Sole Survivor because I want to and I usually get what I want, no matter how hard I have to work for it.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Obsessive-compulsive, receptive and contrarian.
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Alcohol. There's nothing like a truth serum to give the other contestants. A picture of other contestant's loved ones to negotiate with. A vacuum, so people think I'm dumber than they initially thought.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Courtney Yates and Jonathan Penner, personality wise. But I'm much more socially intelligent than they are.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Winning a million dollars and showing the other contestants that signing up for my season of Survivor was a bad idea.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm athletic, but the most useful skill is my positive nature. Other members of the group will feed off my positive demeanor and remain upbeat or at least feel better once they have a conversation with me.
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: It's simple. I'm charismatic and manipulative. This isn't something I'm proud to admit, but it's true.[3]

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: Like Hannibal Lecter, I have good manners and am pleasant company. However, that doesn't mean I won't scramble your brains. One million dollars means freedom, which is priceless to me. I'll give up, let go, surrender- when I'm dead![1]

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Russell Hantz because he is the only person that has ever truly played the game the way you should. The only difference is that I wouldn't wait so long making things disappear.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Truthfully, for the money. I have a family that is very important to me and that is why I work so hard. My youngest daughter has autism and is always in some form of therapy. It costs a lot of money and I make it work, but it would be nice to have some real money in my bank so I don't worry about her as much. I have been watching this game from Season 1, when Rudy should've won until he took his hand off that log. I can play this game and want that Survivor title.

Inspiration in Life: My parents. They worked so hard to provide for 11 of my siblings. During and after the Vietnam war, we were so poor, we had to eat plain rice with soy sauce for months. Somehow they managed to get us all on a fishing boat to escape Communism and luckily we all survived 11 days on the open ocean.

Reason for Being on Survivor: Definitely, the fun of testing my ability to survive in harsh conditions, pushing my body physically and mentally to the fullest. I would love to compete in challenges against younger, stronger or bigger players to prove that size and age does not matter in this game. I believe in playing a good social game, and the nice guy always can win in the end. Also, to win the million dollars!
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: As a gardener and fishermen, I have the outdoor skills to build shelter, climb trees, forage for food, fish and dive. I am a vegetarian but I will harvest sea life for the tribe if it keeps me in the game. I will be useful and work hard at camp. I'm physically fit and will help win challenges. Being the middle child of 11 kids, I know how to get along and be the peacemaker. I can share my childhood war stories to pass time and charm people while bringing good spirit and harmony to the tribe.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: Growing up poor and without many of life's comforts, I have the physical and mental stamina to survive in harsh environments. I'm determined and never give up till I get what I'm after. I am short and non-threatening, most people seem to like me and often are drawn to me for whatever reason. I am genuinely nice and will treat everyone well (but don't cross me, not even once). I will do whatever it takes to become the Sole Survivor. Even though it'll be difficult and devastating to betray my alliance, my ultimate goal is to win. I want to be a winner that everyone thinks is a little odd, but endearing, who plays a smart and interesting game with some spicy drama.[2]

Name (Age): Aubry Bracco (29)
Tribe Designation: Brains
Current Residence: Cambridge, Mass.
Occupation: Social Media Marketer
Personal Claim to Fame: My name (it means ""leader of the elves"") and the way I pursued my education with my own style. I convinced my advisors at Brown University to let me write a children's book about a manatee instead of a 50-page thesis and went on to graduate with honors.
Inspiration in Life: My grandmother, Madeline. She dealt with a crazy Brooklyn Italian family and was a hard worker. She was the first Woman of the Year at the New York Daily News and never let anything get her down (she once went back to work the day after a major car accident). She also had a wacky personality—as kids she told us she didn't eat chicken because ""their legs were too close to their butts.""
Hobbies: Crayon art, running, meeting locals in new places and astrology.
Pet Peeves: People who are not self-aware, don't know how to listen actively or give fake compliments. Close second: scented things covering bad smells.
3 Words to Describe You: Beguiling, intuitive and relentless.
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? 1. Crayons – (preferably a 64-pack with built-in sharpener) to hold an art therapy session to calm everyone down. Plus, they smell good. 2. Camera – to document the adventure. 3. Astrology books – I want to know who I'm dealing with and what motivates people.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Love child of Sophie and Cochran. Hair of Shambo.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I love Survivor. Since I was 15, I've watched. As complicated as the game is, there's something so simple, authentic and raw. I have deep respect for the timelessness and evolution of the game.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm a hard worker who never gives up, and I'd entertain people by pulling a Greg Buis and being a weirdo. People would think I was doing this to be funny and pass time, but I'd actually be extracting key details. After living in Salem, MA during several Halloweens, I've learned to embrace my quirkiness and work with outlandish personalities.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I'm an expert listener and a journalist at heart so I'm inherently observant and social. I look for the most genuine and self-aware person in the room so I can connect with them, and I'm on the prowl for the most fake person in the room so I know what I'm dealing with. I want to prove to myself that I have what it takes to manage personalities under pressure with $1,000,000 on the line.[1]

Hobbies: Travelling, reading and rock climbing.
Pet Peeves: Overpriced alcohol, close talkers and self-important people.3 Words to Describe You: Quirky, charismatic and adventurous.
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? My journal to remind myself of my past and to keep track of my future, a Harry Potter book for a little entertainment, and my sister (does she count?).
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Parvati. She was able to read people and form alliances that took the spotlight off of her. She took respectable chances, never silenced herself to get further, and dominated in challenges.
Reason for Being on Survivor: The adventure junky in me wants take myself out of my comfort zone, but ultimately, I'm applying to win. It's all about the money, honey! My car shakes at any speed over 50 mph so I desperately need to replace that tin can.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: My positivity. I wouldn't let anything dampen my spirit. Enthusiasm is electric, and that attitude would shape the tone around camp. I may be a Jersey girl, but don't let that fool you. I have no problem roughin' it.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I've watched every season, so I know what it takes to be successful on this show. Using my charm, I think I can build strong relationships and lead an alliance without being viewed as aggressive. My social awareness will help me understand and use people's strengths, weaknesses and motives to my advantage. I'm not gonna play on the sidelines. I want to make big, badass moves that will get me further in the game, and have fun doing it.[3]

Tribe designation: Takali (Gen-X)
Three words to describe you: Energetic, authentic, and fun!
Hobbies: Dancing, traveling, and high-ropes or high-adventure activities.
Pet peeves: I guess I would say bad manners.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? We used to be viewed as the slackers until Millennials came along. Kidding. Gen-Xers are hard workers; however, I value what every generation brings to the table.
Personal claim to fame: Sharing my raw story of the tragedies I've been through in a book in order to help others; although, I was scared to because I was so vulnerable.
Inspiration in life: My father because he has great values, is loyal, authentic, and has integrity. He is my hero! Growing up as a child, it was Harriet Tubman because she was courageous, bold, and risked her life to save others.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? SPF, tampons, and lip balm, so I'm camera ready.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Myself, I'm bold, sexy, fun, confident, and real.
Reason for being on Survivor: Winning a million dollars! Also, the experience, which includes the physical challenges, the rewards, and meditating on a tropical island in the morning and at night. I'd also like to inspire Asian Pacific Islanders to be confident and self-expressive!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I aim to be the first Asian Pacific Islander female to win Sole Survivor and $1 million! I have the ability to think so many steps ahead. I've been strategizing since a very young age. (I started competing in chess at 6 years old and won trophies for it!)[2]

Current residence: Los Angeles, CA
Occupation: Gamer
Tribe Designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Courageous, adaptable, and calculating.
Hobbies: Video games, rock climbing, and traveling.
Pet peeves: Stagnation and laziness.
Personal claim to fame: Summiting Mount Kilimanjaro. More than just the accomplishment of climbing a 19,000-foot mountain, it marked my transition from the world I knew everything about, which was the ballet world I dedicated 25 years to, and walking into the unknown, which led me to playing video games for a living.
Inspiration in life: [Facebook Chief Operating Officer] Sheryl Sandberg because she's been a huge inspiration to me and has had a huge impact on the way I've moved up in the industry.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? My journal and a writing tool; my iPhone with wi-fi, so I could Instagram the crap out of the beautiful location; a taco truck endlessly stocked with carne asada tacos, Mexican Coca-Colas and chocolate-covered churros.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I'd like to play like Yul Kwon (Cook Islands). He was fiercely smart and two steps ahead of everyone the entire game. To be in so much control as to not have to play his idol at all was awesome. I'd also like to keep in mind Kelley Wentworth's (San Juan del Sur, Cambodia) gameplay in Second Chance.
Reason for being on Survivor: First, for glory. I love to win. I want to win Survivor. I'm a natural-born competitor and I will play hard because I want that W. To be able to say I've conquered 39 days of mental and physical mayhem and came out on top would be the biggest win for me. I would wear that title so proudly.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am tenacious. I love winning. I play to win. I compete every single day. Video games keep my mind sharp, my hand-eye coordination on point, and constantly hungry to get that W. A background in ballet will shatter everyone else's chance of dominating in any balance challenge. My social game is calculated and precise. Social strategy is what I do. One doesn't accrue over 35 million fans across the internet by chance; it's strategic, calculated, technical, smart, and is exactly how I will play and win Survivor.[2]

Personal claim to fame: Being a father to three beautiful children.
Inspiration in life: David Lee Roth from Van Halen because he became one of the best frontmen in the world and we share the same birthday.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? My propeller necklace because my dad gave it to me; my thumb and pinky rings because my wife gave them to me; and my bracelet with my kids names on it because they keep me grounded.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Ozzy Lusth (Cook Islands, Micronesia, South Pacific) because he has a heart of a lion and I am a lion!

Three words to describe you: Stubborn, hardworking, and controlling.
Hobbies: Lifting weights, cooking with my kids, and watching food shows to find new restaurants.
Pet peeves: Lazy people, people with no common sense, and whiners.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? I grew up a latchkey kid with very little parental supervision. My parents both worked so my siblings and I had a lot more responsibilities and were expected to fend for ourselves. We were extremely obedient because we knew our parents worked very hard and we did not want to disappoint them. Trophies were earned—not given—just for participating in sports. This is the case for most Gen-Xers, which is why we are more independent and results-oriented. We hate being micromanaged and expect people to have ""common sense."" We don't compliment every little thing; we only give praise when well deserved.
Personal claim to fame: Creating a business that provides over 200 jobs for over 10 years.
Inspiration in life: My mother for her ability to hold our family together, even though she had numerous responsibilities and hardships to overcome. At a young age, she had to grow up fast and brought us from Taiwan to Brazil then America to live the life we have now. [She also managed to] overcome financial hardships, cultural and language differences while remaining loving and caring.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Picture of my family because I will miss them; a book to kill time; and a journal to document my experiences.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Jeremy Collins (San Juan del Sur, Cambodia) because I would be a strong player in all aspects of the game and, at the same time, my actions would gain the respect of other players.
Reason for being on Survivor: Primary is to win. Secondary is to compete.

Three words to describe you: Outgoing, strong-minded, and goal setter.
Hobbies: Writing, hiking and working out, and watching reality shows.
Pet peeves: People who can't drive in traffic and people who cough and sneeze without covering their mouths.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? Wow, just thinking about my history, childhood, and past brings me to tears, but also makes me smile. I came from a generation of fighters. The foundation of my family was built on strong women. Yes, my great grandparents, grandparents, and parents were married but, unfortunately, they didn't stay married. During that time, raising children as a single parent was be extremely hard, but the strength the women of my family showed—their will to never give up, their triumph over sweat and tears—shaped me into the woman I am today. We are strong and most of the women I grew up with also demonstrate that same strength and willpower. Nothing was handed to us. We worked hard and, if we failed, we tried again. That's the overall mindset of a Gen-Xer. Never let your failures keep you down. You only stay a failure if you don't get back up and try again.
Personal claim to fame: Overcoming adversity and striving to be the best mother I can be to my children by supporting and pushing them to achieve their goals and dreams while, at the same time, still pushing to achieve my own goals and dreams.
Inspiration in life: My grandmother, Eleanor, because she's a lover, a giver, and she always gives her very last to help anyone, especially her family. Her home is always open and she's always spreading love through her cooking. If you're hungry, you can always sit down and enjoy a meal at my grandmother's house. She's one of my biggest supporters.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? The Bible, which was a gift from my grandfather and I read it daily, and a photograph of my children because they're the strength that keep me going.
Survivor contestant you're most like: A combination of Spencer Bledsoe (Cagayan, Cambodia) and Tasha Fox (Cagayan, Cambodia). Both got far in the game, both are very strategic, and adaptive.
Reason for being on Survivor: A better life for my family. I'm tired of struggling and living check-to-check, or waiting for pay day to buy groceries. I'm tired of living off of my credit card and I love the game. Being on this show is the biggest accomplishment of my life.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I overcame so much adversity in my life. I moved across the country with my children just to provide a better life and opportunity for them. My mind is set to never give up and to keep striving for what I want, so this will be the ultimate goal in my life.[2]

Name: Jessica ""Figgy"" Figueroa
Age: 23
Current residence: Nashville, TN
Occupation: Bartender
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Adventurous, free spirit, and crowd pleaser.
Hobbies: Kayaking, videography, and watching football.
Pet peeves: When people are lazy and expect things to just happen. That's not what life is about. Get up and fight.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? Being a Millennial means being blessed with an innovative and creative mind, and the world is at my fingertips. It's all there; I just have to make it happen. I work hard for where I want to be and for everything I have. Millennials get stuff done and work hard while throwing a good snap in our [Snapchat] stories every now and again.
Personal claim to fame: Moving to Nashville and standing on my own two feet at a vulnerable moment in my life. Leaving all that you know for a city of unfamiliarity? Scary. That's why I'm ready for a bigger challenge. Survivor is the ultimate challenge.
Inspiration in life: My mother. She did everything she could to make life for us okay, having gone through a very toxic relationship with our father. She showed me courage and strength in standing up for herself and showing us what we are worth. I admire her for that.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? I'd bring a razor, a pair of water shoes—I'd rather not step on sea urchins, but if I must, I must—and a blanket. I don't consider that to be a survival item; I could use a tribe member for that.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I love Stephenie LaGrossa (Palau, Guatemala, Heroes vs. Villains.) She's just so tough in so many ways and she's strategic. She shows some moments of weakness but, at the end of it, she is still a tough chick and she fights to stay alive. I admire her.
Reason for being on Survivor: The challenge. I was brought up in a crazy household outside of the inner city with crime happening right outside our windows. I have had to fight for everything I have ever had in my life, and Survivor is the ultimate fight I want to take on. Mentally and physically, my strength is unreal.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Of course I'll survive. Why else would I even apply? I'm young and full of knowledge. I don't just go along for the ride; I'm a leader. I will lead my tribe and make it to the end with my lovable personality, my drive, and work ethic. It's destiny.[2]

Age: 25
Current residence: Fort Worth, TX
Occupation: Vacation club sales
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Intelligent, fun, and competitive.
Hobbies: Traveling, eating, and cuddling.
Pet peeves: When incompetent people try to instruct me, when people do things inefficiently or wrong, when I lose, and when other people make me lose.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? To be a Millennial is to resonate with the idea that I can design my own life. It's the notion that I should have the desires of my heart, not because I am ""entitled"" to them, but because God granted me the ability to attain them. Being a Millennial means I am bold enough to state a want and stubborn enough to work for it, despite obstacles and the opinions of others. It means that my journey is only a failure if I stop moving forward.
Personal claim to fame: Paying off my student loan debt is the crowning achievement of my twenties thus far. As a low-income student at a pricey suburban university, I worked two to three jobs during the majority of my college career, had very little fun, and made every decision based on money. When I graduated and began working as an admission counselor, I kept my expenses low by eating PB&J for lunch, denying myself cable and internet, sticking to my flip phone, and driving my 1992 Honda Accord. After years of being teased for my frugal ways, I got the last laugh when I paid off $31,000 in loans at the age of 23.
Inspiration in life: My godfather is my hero. He was about 60 years old when I was born. He had no children of his own and was the ultimate father figure in my life. For 20 years, he has read the Bible every day. When I was younger, he took care of me, showed me what to value in a man, and raised me to tell the truth, trust in God, be confident in myself, do my best, and not fear mistakes. His influence led me to be a magna cum laude college graduate. The person I am is because of him.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A mirror because I'll feel better if I can look better and I'll have no idea how I look if I can't see myself. A book because it will give me something to listen to besides myself and keep my mind sharp. Being alone and thinking too much drives people crazy. Finally, chocolate because sometimes a taste of something sweet can boost my mood.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I'd play like a combination of Tasha Fox (Cagayan, Cambodia), Kelley Wentworth (San Juan del Sur, Cambodia) and Natalie Anderson (San Juan del Sur). Tasha was in the right alliances and never had her loyalty questioned. I love that Wentworth was crafty, played hard, took risks, and was an asset in challenges. Natalie represents my inner beast; she was athletic, spunky, played a social game, made big moves, and actually won.
Reason for being on Survivor: My motivation is the $1 million. My goal is to leave an inheritance to my children's children. Winning Survivor would be a start.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will be the Sole Survivor because I will adapt to everything the game throws at me. My experience in sales has made me nearly immune to rejection, so things not going my way won't take my head out of the game. Physically, I'm in great shape. Also, I'm a fairly rational thinker, so I will separate what I do in real life from what I need to do to win this game.[2]

Pet peeves: Windshield wipers on a dry window.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? Being a Millennial means I can think outside the box. It means I won't settle for mediocrity but, rather, strive for the best outcome. It also means I know what a hashtag is and how to fix just about anything using YouTube or Google.
Personal claim to fame: Travelling two months in Europe by myself for less than $3000—including airfare!—or winning two state cross-country championships.
Inspiration in life: Can I say God? He created everything we've ever seen, touched, and experienced. He knows everything there is to know about everything... because he created it. He must be big, intelligent, majestic, and awesome.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A good book to stimulate me mentally, spiritually, philosophically; waterproof mascara because I want to stay hot, especially on TV; and a large comfy bed.
Survivor contestant you're most like: ""Boston"" Rob Mariano (Marquesas, All-Stars, Heroes vs. Villains, Redemption Island) because of his puzzle game, ability to lead people, control decisions.
Reason for being on Survivor: A challenging and exciting adventure—and money!

What does it mean to be a Millennial? Come on, man! We are open-minded, liberal, self-expressive, upbeat, connected, tech savvy, and we invented the words ""sicky sicky, gnar gnar, rachet, clutch, bae, and LOL."" I love my generation. We are all-around epic.
Personal claim to fame: Learning to play guitar. Not many people keep their passions.
Inspiration in life: [Scottish knight] William Wallace. I am a fan of fearless people.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A toothbrush, lip balm, and, most of all, my banjo.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I would say Woo Hwang (Cagayan, Cambodia) because I am tricky and funny. But, if it came to it, I would not let another castaway walk off with my money!
Reason for being on Survivor: In all honesty, I have not thought about the money; I just want to kick ass at this game.

Three words to describe you: Super competitive because I don't lose, tenacious because I never give up, and I'm a fighter.
Hobbies: Working out to relive stress, strategizing to be successful, and challenging myself to be the best.
Pet peeves: Smacking gum. I hate it. I would do away with all gum on earth if I could.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? To me, it means that you work hard. It means you get up with a purpose and a goal each day. It means that you can do anything in America as long as you work hard and never give up.
Personal claim to fame: I came from nothing. I came from a trailer with no running water left behind by a drug-trafficking father at 15. I overcame tremendous odds. I put myself through college on a football scholarship. I put myself through law school. I did this on my own and have earned the respect of an entire community. For years, my hometown of Sulphur, Oklahoma, had a sign that said: ""The Home of Chris Hammons."" The sign is actually in my garage now.
Inspiration in life: Gerry Spence because he's the America's greatest trial lawyer that ever lived. He has fought for American rights longer than I've been alive. He gives me inspiration to continue that great fight so the accused, the oppressed, the injured, the ""little guy"" will have a voice in America. When we, trial lawyers, quit fighting, Americans will have no voice. He is a true patriot and the most loving man I have ever met. Without his program and path, I might have been lost the rest of my life.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A medicine pouch given to me by an Indian Chief and blessed with love and caring, which would give me power in challenges; a journal and pencil to document my adventure but, more than that, write down all the details of each member so I could memorize their stories better; and a picture of my boys. I would use the pain of not seeing them as motivation. When I feel down, I will look at that picture and turn the sadness to rage for a challenge.
Survivor contestant you're most like: ""Boston"" Rob Mariano (Marquesas, All-Stars, Heroes vs. Villains, Redemption Island.) He gave one of the most dominant performances ever on Survivor.
Reason for being on Survivor: My primary motivation is to win. I love Survivor and have wanted to be on it for years. Life seems to get in the way of adventures. I love competition and I just see Survivor as the ultimate game and the ultimate competition.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have always been able to juggle people and their different personalities. I can tolerate almost all types of people and connect with them. I will make the big moves when it is time. I have a great memory and will be able to keep the stories of contestants in my head and use them as needed.

What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? My parents were farmers and they worked harder than anyone I have ever known. There were no vacations, days off, or breaks. No matter the weather, their health, or lack of money, they never gave up. They never stopped. That lesson has never left me. No one will live my life for me. No one is going to give me a break. If I want something, I have to get up and do it, regardless of how I may feel or how hard it may be. My life was decided by no one but myself. I saw the struggle my parents endured and I made a promise to myself to never stop trying to achieve any goal I set out to achieve. Nothing I have was handed to me. I had to earn it and I continue to do so every day.
Personal claim to fame: Getting into law school, making it through, passing the bar and excelling as a prosecutor. I did all of this while also getting married and starting a family. Within a six-year time span, I was married, graduated undergrad, started law school, had my first child, passed the bar, was hired as a prosecutor, and had my second child. I recently had a trial in which the jury gave me a round of applause when it was completed. The presiding judge later told me he had never seen a prosecutor get a round of applause—and he has been on the bench for over 20 years. That moment was confirmation that the lack of sleep, long hours, hard work, and mental strain were all truly worth enduring.
Inspiration in life: My dad. He was born to be a farm hand and his upbringing was extremely difficult. He is truly dedicated to his family and has a spirit and will that's indescribable.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Lip balm because it travels everywhere with me. Champagne and salt and vinegar chips, which I am lumping into one item because they always go together. Pictures of my family for inspiration and a reminder of what truly matters.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Cirie Fields (Panama, Micronesia, Heroes vs. Villains). Her early life struggles are very similar to my own. This caused both of us to develop a resilient personality, the ability to push ourselves, and never give up. This, along with our strong desire to help our families, gave us what many people lack—drive.
Reason for being on Survivor: My life is like that set of stairs in the movie Labyrinth: the directions don't make sense nor does the order, but I always manage to find my way through and get where I want to go. For me, those stairs never stop. My motivation comes from within and I will never be done or satisfied.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? My job requires me to be a great storyteller and I have the burden to prove my case to a jury, which I welcome every time. That burden comes with a significant amount of responsibility and pressure. I must convince a jury of 12 people that the evidence presented and the case I put forth proves the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. No matter the situation or circumstances, I must maintain my composure, all the while focusing on obtaining the right result. That is the essence of Survivor.[2]

Name: Zeke Smith
Age: 28
Current residence: Brooklyn, NY
Occupation: Asset manager
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Sharp, devilish, and unstoppable.
Hobbies: Writing, improv, gym, and cooking.
Pet peeves: Sniffling. Chewing with one's mouth open. Black shoes with brown belts. Children who don't listen to their mothers.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? To be perfectly honest, I've never thought of myself as a Millennial. Ask one of the other children.
Personal claim to fame: Being ranked one of the Top 16 high-school debaters in the country my senior year of high school. I got a plaque. It's been downhill ever since.
Inspiration in life: Joan Rivers. She told Helen Keller jokes into her eighties. The woman lived.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
1. Hairspray: ostensibly for applications in fire making, but actually to keep my hair high and tight.
2. Coffee: to calm the nerves and awaken the senses, so to be on alert for plots against me. Coffee treatments also bring out my hair's natural shimmer.
3. Industrial-sized vat of peanut butter: who wouldn't bring a high-protein, high-fat, delicious treat to a starvation marathon? And, lest we forget, peanut butter is a magnificent deep conditioner.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Tony Vlachos (Cagayan). I mean, I'm not personally like a cop from New Jersey. I would never live in New Jersey, are you kidding me? Excuse me? New Jersey? Where Tony and I intersect is our unbridled passion for Survivor. I came to lie, manipulate, and make big moves, which, on Day 39, will leave no one doubting that I played the superior game. Seriously, New Jersey?
Reason for being on Survivor: I love Survivor! I've dreamed of starving on desert beaches and running around in my unwashed underwear for years! It's long been my desire for Jeff Probst to reward my mastery of lying and manipulation with $1 million dollars.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I'm tough as nails. Try and tear me down. Furthermore, people fascinate me. I can get along with anyone because I tend to be more curious than judgmental of an individual's quirks. I'm surprisingly adept in the out-of-doors and have been killing myself in the gym for the past six months, so I shouldn't drag ass in challenges. Hopefully, all those hours... okay, days.... fine, years spent watching Survivor and listening to Survivor podcasts will yield at least some aptitude at the game.[2]

Age: 18
Current residence: Long Valley, NJ

Three words to describe you: Cunning, adaptable, and dynamic.
Hobbies: Watching TV (mostly Survivor), camping and fishing, and reading news articles.
Pet peeves: People who are fake and/or stuck-up.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? A Millennial is creative, resourceful, intelligent, and, above all else, adaptable.
Personal claim to fame: Being the youngest person to ever compete on Survivor, which is a dream that has finally become a reality.
Inspiration in life: Jesus Christ and Ronald Reagan.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Noise cancelling headphones so I won't have to hear any annoying people; a tent to stay dry in during the rain; and a Bible so that I can keep my sanity.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I don't want to play like any past Survivor. Each season is its own game and should be unique. I will play the way I need to play in order to manipulate people. However, I do respect Randy Bailey (Gabon, Heroes vs. Villains).
Reason for being on Survivor: My primary motivation is to show people that, even though I'm young, I can do anything an older person can do and more. People don't respect youth and I'm going to make them regret that. My secondary motivation is to screw with people's heads and lie every chance I get. It just sounds like fun.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have a way of making people feel comfortable. I can manipulate people into thinking they are in control when, really, I'm the one making the big moves necessary to win.[2]

Name: Sunday Burquest
Age: 45
Current residence: Otsego, MN
Occupation: Youth pastor
Tribe designation: Takali (Gen-X)
Three words to describe you: Bossy, compassionate, and tenacious.
Hobbies: Repurposing and painting furniture, interior design, and thrift shopping because I love the thrill of the hunt for a good deal.
Pet peeves: Arrogant people and those who think they're God's gift to the human race. Catty women who make the snide comments, back-handed compliments, and make other girls in the room feel like they don't measure up. Plus, people who are late drive me nuts.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? For myself, being a Gen-Xer means being driven and hard working. We don't expect things to be handed to us; we set goals and work hard for what we want in life. We also don't think we deserve to win in every situation and actually look at failure as an opportunity to learn. On the other hand, Gen-Xers can be stuck in our ways and leery of new ideas. It would help a lot if we would learn to listen to the younger generation and run with some of their new ideas.
Personal claim to fame: Besides my four amazing kids, I'm most proud of being a breast cancer survivor. After five surgeries, eight rounds of chemotherapy, and 28 days of radiation—not to mention the horrible meds they put you on—I'm still here! It was important to me that my kids saw me as a ""warrior,"" rather than as a whiner. Of course, it was hard, but I wouldn't let cancer take over my life. Because of my faith, I was able to kick cancer's butt!
Inspiration in life: My inspiration comes from my relationship with the Lord. My faith has shaped my attitude in life and has given me the ability to be genuinely happy. Aside from my faith, my mom is my hero. She is the toughest lady. I get my tenacity and ""never quit"" attitude from her. I've watched her succeed despite her difficult upbringing, dealing with me and my brothers as teenagers, and enduring a bone-marrow transplant. No matter what happens, she keeps getting back up and going again!
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A deck of cards because I love playing games and it helps break down walls with people you don't know; lip gloss because I always feel a little better about myself with a little color on my lips; and '80s music because I love singing with friends and, no matter how off-key you all are, it's always fun.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I'd play the game most like Lisa Whelchel (Philippines). I see a lot of myself in her. Not only has she been through difficult times, but her faith stayed intact. We're both moms and I see myself ""mothering"" some of the younger players, as she did. I see myself trying my best to play the game according to my faith, yet making sure I actually play the game. I know there will come a point I will have to deceive to get ahead; I plan to do it in the context of the game.
Reason for being on Survivor: My primary motivation is of course a $1 million! Second, I want to prove to myself that I can do it. As a fan of the show from the very first season, I've spent hours dreaming about being on the island, making alliances, finding Hidden Immunity Idols, and, most of all, walking away with the title of Sole Survivor!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I believe my strong personality will keep me going on the island. I know I'm good with people, especially young people because I work with them for a living, and this will help me gain allies on my tribe. My leadership skills will be useful in getting work done around camp.[2]

Name: Justin ""Jay"" Starrett
Age: 27
Current residence: Fort Lauderdale, FL
Occupation: Real estate agent
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Determined, intelligent, and funny.
Hobbies: Skimboarding, fishing, and pretty much any sport.
Pet peeves: I don't like when people make plans or say they're going to do something and they don't deliver.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? Millennial means ""freedom"" to me. I say this because we are born in a time when anything is truly possible; social media and all these different outlets help you to not only learn information quickly, but gives you the capability to become or create anything. Being a Millennial, you can chase your dreams and do things that are out-of-the-box; as long as you are working towards your dream and not just sitting there thinking about it, you can become successful.
Personal claim to fame: Purchasing my house at the age of 25.
Inspiration in life: I would definitely have to say my beautiful mother is my hero. Through everything—including past divorces and serious health issues—she still pushes forward like the little Peruvian soldier she is. She's had 10 brain aneurisms and received surgical care for six of them. She wakes up every day smiling and not only motivates and inspires me, but everyone she comes in contact with. I am truly blessed.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? iPod because I'm always dancing or jamming out to something; a skimboard just in case there are some waves to ride; and a DVD player with DVDs, so I can lie back and relax after my hard day of living life like a caveman.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I have to say Russell Hantz (Samoa, Heroes vs. Villains, Redemption Island) and Woo Hwang (Cagayan, Cambodia). Not only will I constantly look through everything to find clues, I'll be observant to all of my surroundings. I'll align myself with the men and women to make everyone believe I want to make a team; but, all the while, I'll be backstabbing and making big moves to eliminate any threat I may feel will get in the way of my success. Did I mention I'll be doing this with a smile on my face that will have to make them vote for me in the end?
Reason for being on Survivor: Sometimes I take the things for granted and I would like to strip myself of all the comforts. I want to go out there and play this game and win. I want to be with nature again and I want to lose myself, so I can rediscover myself. The other reason is simple; it's a million dollars. Come on. That could change everything in a person's life.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will be the final Survivor. Period. I am mentally strong and will push my body to any limit it has to go. I am extremely intelligent, determined, and focused on winning. I have a ton of street smarts and know how to maneuver and manipulate people to get the things I want. I'm a flirtatious, outgoing, good-looking guy who is not afraid to work hard and make big moves.[2]

Current residence: Dedham, MA
Occupation: Police sergeant

Three words to describe you: Gregarious, funny/hilarious, and caring.
Hobbies: Going to the gym, golf, improv, and bicycling.
Pet peeves: Couples who sit on the same side of the booth, people who talk politics and religion at Thanksgiving dinner, and bullies.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? A Gen-Xer is someone who had to work very hard for everything that they have in life. They actually had to go to school (not just online), ride the bus, and study hard to get good grades. Gen-Xer's take responsibility for their own actions and don't blame others for their mistakes. Gen-Xer's remember a time when Saturday morning brought the best cartoons, they know the difference between VHS and Betamax, and they certainly know what it means to drop a dime.
Personal claim to fame: Receiving the Human Award for Bravery from the Governor of Massachusetts for disarming a gunman in 2014.
Inspiration in life: My father Donald LaBelle because he's funny, honest, and compassionate, and would give the shirt off his back, if need be.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Sunglasses because the sun is very bright out in the open; toothbrush because healthy teeth are the key to a healthy life, no matter where you are; and toilet paper, which is self-explanatory.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I would say Jonathan Penner (Cook Islands, Micronesia, Philippines) because we are both funny, easygoing, and under the radar.
Reason for being on Survivor: I love this game! Who wouldn't want to get the chance to take part in this amazing adventure? My second motivation is the million dollars.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will win this game. I'm extremely likeable and can relate to a lot of different people. I can read people like a book. I can tell if someone is lying to me or telling me the truth from my 18 years as a police officer. I will lead people without them knowing I'm leading them.[1]

Pet peeves: Sudden, loud noises; people who don't use a turn signal; people who believe in ghosts and psychics; people who are late for dinner; people who incorrectly use the word ""nonplussed;"" people.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? Gen-Xers believe in hard work, earning their rewards, and eating breakfast. Why does no one eat breakfast anymore?!
Personal claim to fame: Playing chess against Magnus Carlsen, the No. 1 ranked player in the world.
Inspiration in life: Mr. Spock [from Star Trek]. He's highly intelligent, logical, and has trouble fitting in.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Beads, string, and polished stones to make fake Immunity Idols for other people to find.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I relate most to the guys who don't fit in such as John Cochran (South Pacific, Caramoan)—he's my intellectual equal with slightly larger muscles. I also relate to Joe Anglim's (Worlds Apart, Cambodia) puzzle-solving skills, but, unfortunately, not his full head of hair, or way with the ladies.
Reason for being on Survivor: I want to use Survivor as a tool to battle my insecurities and overcome my fears and anxiety.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? My weaknesses and flaws are my strengths. Because of my small size and lack of physical stature, people won't perceive me as a threat. I also have the most important Survivor trait one can have: paranoia. My eyes and ears will be at full attention, searching for any hint of a vote going bad for me. Chess has taught me to always look ahead, so I'm prepared to seize an opportunity when one presents itself. I won't let emotions and feelings stand in the way of reaching Final 3.[2]

Three words to describe you: Nerdy, competitive, and weird.
Hobbies: Skiing, scuba diving, eating, plus I can hula-hoop and walk at the same time.
Pet peeves: Someone who likes to kill people. Not sure why, that's just such a pet peeve of mine! Also, people who stick their gum on public benches or fart in small elevators.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? Being a Millennial means being hip, cool, nifty and totally rad. Go young people! No, I'm not secretly an 80-year-old neurotic Jewish lady. I don't know what you're talking about.
Personal claim to fame: I was Ben Franklin in my eighth-grade production of 1776. I sang out of tune, people clapped, and it was an electric moment of fame.
Inspiration in life: My mother. She has super-human levels of toughness. I cry when I bump my arm into something too hard, when an authority figure yells at me, or if I see a video of a cat being tickled. My mom is the opposite. She is a freakin' warrior and I'm her odd, terrified child.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
1. A journal: One with an old school lock on it that says ""KEEP OUT"" on the front. That way, I could write to stay sane and nobody would read what I wrote because there's a ""KEEP OUT"" sign on it.
2. An old buff I bought: I did a two-week rafting trip a while back to see if I could handle Survivor because I had never camped before.
3. An old-timey compass: People would be, like, she must be hip! Just look at that old-timey compass.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I'm a big John Cochran (South Pacific, Caramoan) fan. He used his humor and fish out of water-ness to control the game without seeming threatening. Cochran had a buff collection and wrote a paper on Survivor at Harvard Law School. I wrote my college common application essay about wanting to be on Survivor, so I can relate to his super fan-ness; plus, we were both obviously super cool in middle school.
Reason for being on Survivor: I've been a fan of Survivor since I was 14. My friend and I would throw Survivor parties where we would eat worms and dirt (aka gummy worms and Oreos), while the castaways starved, and fancy food when they won Reward Challenges. Simply stated, being a Survivor contestant has been a dream of mine forever. Plus, I like the idea that 14-year-old me would find 24-year-old me cool.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I probably won't. I've tripped walking down a sidewalk, so imagine that person in the wilderness.[2]

Hobbies: Anything outdoors (i.e. hiking, camping and fishing), playing and watching music, and dancing.
Pet peeves: Superficial connections and communication.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? It's a generation of hard workers who were on the cusp of some incredible social, political and technological shifts. We are competent and capable in the ""new world"" yet are happy outside, while disconnected from our devices.
Personal claim to fame: The development of my non-profit, HumaneKind.
Inspiration in life: I admire the Dalai Lama's compassion, wisdom with forgiveness, and willingness to give of himself.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A ukulele to play and sing with; a good book because I love inspiring literature; and a frisbee because no one is ever down throwing one around.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Ozzy Lusth (Cook Islands, Micronesia, South Pacific) because of his easy temperament, his fierce competitiveness, his resourcefulness, and knowledge of how to survive in the wild. Also, he seems idealistic and optimistic, in general.
Reason for being on Survivor: To win! To show my daughter my strengths and what it looks like to fight for something.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have the outdoor skills and physical attributes to be an asset to those around me, and I understand and read people well enough to know where to position myself.[3]

Name: Adam Klein
Age: 25
Current residence: San Francisco, CA
Occupation: Homeless shelter manager
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Intelligent, confident, and personable.
Hobbies: Board games, poker, browsing the Survivor Subreddit, and travel.
Pet peeves: Bullies, long lines, and smokers.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? Millennials believe that, in this moment, anything is possible. If you have dreams, go after them. If you want to change the world, change it. I don't believe you have to ""pay your dues"" making copies and fetching coffee before you can be successful—or before you can make a difference. Don't just work harder, work smarter, and make your goals a reality! My dream is to win Survivor and I'm going to make it happen!
Personal claim to fame: As a volunteer, I chaired a Relay For Life event that raised over $135,000 for cancer research and grew in size from about 10 youth participants to over 500. If any of that money helps save my mom's life, then it is, by far, my most important accomplishment.
Inspiration in life: My mom. She is surviving lung cancer and has survivorship in her blood [because] her mom survived Auschwitz. She is incredibly physically fit and otherwise healthy. She can tear up the dance floor—that's where I get my moves!—and she's my best friend and supporter.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A picture of my family to keep myself grounded and focused, a fake Hidden Immunity Idol because the threat can be just as powerful as the real thing, and a razor because I hate mustaches with a fiery passion.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Spencer Bledsoe (Cagayan, Cambodia). We are both wise beyond our years, can easily play up to the egos of older and stronger players, are strategic thinkers, and are widely underestimated in the game. I also relate to the never-say-die nature and social finesse of Hayden Moss (Blood vs. Water).
Reason for being on Survivor: When I set a goal in life, I achieve it. As an ultimate super-duper fan, winning Survivor is an unrealized goal that I simply must accomplish. I have dreamed of winning Survivor since I was 9 years old, even going so far as to play Survivor online when I was in middle school. The money is secondary, but not unimportant because it would allow me to continue my passion for social justice.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? No one is going to fight as hard as I will for that title. I may be—and look—young, I may be small, but my fellow competitors won't know what kind of power punch I pack until they are already knocked out. I will use my youthful charm and energy, combined with my strategic nature to win. I come from a long line of real-life survivors, and I am next.[3]

Inspiration in Life: My father for being the dad that he was. He was a great role model and I hope that I can be the same for my children.
Hobbies: Jet skiing, playing pool and surfing the web.
Pet Peeves: Thugs who wear skinny jeans. Also, people who see me speaking on the phone, but yet they feel the need to start a conversation with me. Like it's that urgent for them to know ""how's it going"" while I'm speaking on the phone. SO RUDE!!!
3 Words to Describe You: Versatile, clever and competitive.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? Cigarettes, coffee and liquor. I don't smoke or drink coffee or liquor, but I would love to bring those items with me just so that I can barter with my tribemates! You know at some point in the game they would even give up immunity just to have a little taste of these items.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Russell Hantz, because I can be just as devious. Boston Rob, because I can be just as slick.
Reason for Being on Survivor: My main reason: The MILLION DOLLARS of course. There's no way I would be going out there for half that prize! Secondly, I'm a huge fan of the show and I would love to give the fans a great season to be remembered.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: Adapt and overcome! That's the kind of training I have as a cop and that's exactly what I'm going to do on that island! Adapt and I will overcome!
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have been a street cop for 12 years. My experiences as a cop give me a huge advantage going into this game. Being outside my element is my forte. That's what I do for a living. What's going to be normal for me will be very stressful for the average castaway.
Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? Sounds like a trick question. Well let's see. I'm a beautiful person that has a sharp brain and strong muscles. Based on appearance, I would consider myself ""Brawn."" For the purposes of Survivor though, I would consider myself ""Brains."" Maybe I wasn't the smartest in school, but I was always the sharpest!!!

Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? Survivor is definitely a game of all-around strategy. Brawn and beauty can fight over silver, but Brains would surely bring home the gold![1]

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Hayden because I really loved him on the show and he was athletic. He knows when to be a beast and how to play.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Winning the money to better life financing. Also, I love the woods and anything survival related. I feel I can survive anything, so I want to be put to the test!
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I am an ex-military man and very well trained in survival. I'm a tough competitor and can make fire out of nothing, build shelter, create insulation, help catch and kill food. I'm the die-hard outdoors man that can and will survive!

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have the skills it takes to get through the tough situations of little to no water, or little to no food and I make things happen. If I made it through a war zone for 11 months, I can make it through a jungle for 39 days![2]

Personal Claim to Fame: Once I spent over a month with Abi-Maria Gomes, and I'm still considered legally sane by the state of California.
Inspiration in Life: O.J. Simpson before the murder trial. When he was a kid he had Rickets. For his birthday when he was still young his father took him to a signing to meet Jim Brown and O.J. hobbled right up to him and told him he was going to break all his records which he eventually did. I'm a sucker for underdog stories.
Hobbies: Exercising, writing/reading and partying.
Pet Peeves: Ex-TV stars.
3 Words to Describe You: Charming, brilliant and slightly-less cocky than the last time I did this.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? 1) Soap - Not for me; for whoever I end up cuddling with at night. 2) Book of puzzles – Your mind is a muscle and needs to be kept in shape. 3) The Hidden Immunity Idol I never played in the Philippines - Early advantage. Seems obvious.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: This feels like a trick question.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I'm a super-fan of the show. Getting to do it once was incredible. To get a second chance… How could anyone say no?
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: Experience plays a huge roll in any situation in life. I made it through 38 days the first time so I have to like my survival odds the second time around. Oh, and I'm also smart, athletic and nice to look at.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: You play the game to win the game. I'm not on Survivor to ""have a life-changing experience"" or ""grow as a person"" or ""see how far I can make it."" Those things may happen, but that's not the reason I'm out there. The best thing I have going for me is my single-mindedness and focus towards a single goal: a seven-digit bank account.[3]

Tribe Designation: No Collar (Nagarote)
Current Residence: San Francisco
Occupation: Law Student
Personal Claim to Fame: Catching a huuuge wave last winter in Kauai.
Inspiration in Life: Clara S. Foltz- First female lawyer on the west coast and inventor of public defense. I admire her trail-blazing approach to law and life. My law school, UC Hastings, refused to admit her based on sex, so she sued them and graduated at the top of her class (while raising five children).
Hobbies: Surfing, jiu jitsu, motorcycles and whatever comes my way.
What is your favorite sport? Jiu-jitsu and surfing.
Pet Peeves: Not maximizing time and resources.
3 Words to Describe You: Tenacious, free and focused.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? 1. Law school bar review book - so I can stay sharp, plus it doubles as a journal. 2. A pen and journal - to map out strategy. 3. Ukulele - because it lifts the spirits and could become useful in other, non-musical ways.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Parvati Shallow because she is fun and vivacious, but more than meets the eye, always planning, calculating risks both strategic and social. She is physically strong and undaunted by rejection and resistance. We also have matching tats.
Reason for Being on Survivor: The game itself. It is the ultimate personal challenge and something to tell the grandkids.
Why You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm inimitably resourceful. Last summer, I caught a fish in a plastic grocery bag while camping and cleaned and cooked the fish for friends. I'm upbeat and fun, so surviving socially will be no sweat. I also perform well under pressure.

Why Will You Be the Sole Survivor: I grab everything I do by the horns and don't let go until I get what I want. Survivor will be no different.[1]

Oscar ""Ozzy"" Lusth (30)
Current Residence: Venice, Calif.
Previous Seasons: Survivor: Cook Islands and Survivor: Micronesia
Ozzy Lusth may be a surfer from Venice, Calif. but he takes the game of Survivor seriously. ""I'm here to play in a humble way, but I'm also here to win."" This will be his third time playing Survivor, and he believes the game has made him a stronger person. ""For the last two seasons, I feel it has really changed me for the better. And, I'm looking for this last, this third experience, to really be the end to it all, the redemption.""
In previous seasons, Ozzy dominated in challenges but did not have the best social game and was even voted out of Survivor: Micronesia with an idol in his possession. He has grown a lot since the last time Jeff Probst snuffed his torched and is ready to give the game another shot. ""The last Tribal Council that I went through, the one that voted me off, I've got to let that go, but I have to be able to remember and go back and say there were signs.""
Not only has Ozzy matured as a player, but he has also transformed his personal life. Born in Mexico, Ozzy takes pride in his heritage and his community. In 2009, he started the non-profit organization, MexicoSkateProject.org, to help grow the popularity of skateboarding and build skate parks in every town or pueblo in Mexico.

What does he think of Coach, his competition? ""Honestly, I'm actually pretty excited that Coach is here. He can be a polarizing character but I think that he respects the way that I play the game, and I respect the way he plays.""[3]

Name (Age): Debbie Wanner (49)
Tribe Designation: Brains
Current Residence: Reading, Penn.
Occupation: Chemist
Personal Claim to Fame: Being the first in my family to graduate college, learning was always valued, but not formal education. My family was/is dysfunctional, to put it mildly.
Inspiration in Life: I just adore Tia Torres of Pit Bulls and Parolees - talk about Survivors!
Hobbies: Working out (hiking and running), flying, snowmobiles, horses, boating, playing piano, rescuing Boston terriers and tortoises, juggling and reading, especially American and Roman history.
Pet Peeves: The idolization of garish, repugnant and supercilious people-like the Kardashians; pets as fashion accessories; apathy-don't just talk about doing it, do it and help make the world a better place.
3 Words to Describe You: Relentless, erudite and Spartan.
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Chanel No. 5 as I know how bad we will all smell, dental floss because I love clean teeth and it has multiple uses and a big stuffed Boston terrier.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Coach. Period.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Money, because poverty sucks and money equals power to a point. Also, I relish an adventure.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I have military training in summer and winter survival, shelter building, fire making, food procurement, torture training and a superior will to survive. Plus, I'm fun too! I'm a card carrying member of the Reading Juggler's club, so I'll teach them how to juggle.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: Like Hannibal Lecter, I have good manners and am pleasant company. However, that doesn't mean I won't scramble your brains. One million dollars means freedom, which is priceless to me. I'll give up, let go, surrender- when I'm dead![1]

Name: Zeke Smith
Age: 28
Current residence: Brooklyn, NY
Occupation: Asset manager
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Sharp, devilish, and unstoppable.
Hobbies: Writing, improv, gym, and cooking.
Pet peeves: Sniffling. Chewing with one's mouth open. Black shoes with brown belts. Children who don't listen to their mothers.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? To be perfectly honest, I've never thought of myself as a Millennial. Ask one of the other children.
Personal claim to fame: Being ranked one of the Top 16 high-school debaters in the country my senior year of high school. I got a plaque. It's been downhill ever since.
Inspiration in life: Joan Rivers. She told Helen Keller jokes into her eighties. The woman lived.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
1. Hairspray: ostensibly for applications in fire making, but actually to keep my hair high and tight.
2. Coffee: to calm the nerves and awaken the senses, so to be on alert for plots against me. Coffee treatments also bring out my hair's natural shimmer.
3. Industrial-sized vat of peanut butter: who wouldn't bring a high-protein, high-fat, delicious treat to a starvation marathon? And, lest we forget, peanut butter is a magnificent deep conditioner.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Tony Vlachos (Cagayan). I mean, I'm not personally like a cop from New Jersey. I would never live in New Jersey, are you kidding me? Excuse me? New Jersey? Where Tony and I intersect is our unbridled passion for Survivor. I came to lie, manipulate, and make big moves, which, on Day 39, will leave no one doubting that I played the superior game. Seriously, New Jersey?
Reason for being on Survivor: I love Survivor! I've dreamed of starving on desert beaches and running around in my unwashed underwear for years! It's long been my desire for Jeff Probst to reward my mastery of lying and manipulation with $1 million dollars.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I'm tough as nails. Try and tear me down. Furthermore, people fascinate me. I can get along with anyone because I tend to be more curious than judgmental of an individual's quirks. I'm surprisingly adept in the out-of-doors and have been killing myself in the gym for the past six months, so I shouldn't drag ass in challenges. Hopefully, all those hours... okay, days.... fine, years spent watching Survivor and listening to Survivor podcasts will yield at least some aptitude at the game.[2]

Occupation: Barrel Racer
Personal Claim to Fame: I was the National Champion Barrel Racer and All Around Cowgirl in High School Rodeo and also a National Champion in College rodeo rankings.
Inspiration in Life: I can't just pick one. But, my mom and dad are my heroes because they have been through so much and through it all they stay positive. They are my main support system and I wouldn't have accomplished what I have if it wasn't for them.
Hobbies: Rodeo, basketball, football, hunting and fishing.
What is your favorite sport? Rodeo, basketball and long distance running.
Pet Peeves: Being late because it's so disrespectful, when people loudly chew their food and underachievers (at least give it an honest try).
3 Words to Describe You: Competitive, athletic and outgoing.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? 1. A radio because music makes my soul happy. 2. A notepad and pen because I love writing down my thoughts and goals. 3. Chocolate milk because I literally can drink a gallon in two days.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Parvati Shallow, hands down, because she's not overly aggressive and uses her female traits to her advantage, she's a very intelligent woman.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I truly believe there is little I cannot do. My physical, mental and emotional capabilities are of a man's level.
Why You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm not afraid to set impossible goals and strive to achieve them. I'm extremely athletic and push my body to its utmost limit.

Why Will You Be the Sole Survivor: I am a 6'1"" model and most people just see me as a pretty face, but I'm a cowgirl and rancher who doesn't mind doing a man's job. I am also an extreme athlete. I played basketball, volleyball and ran track and cross-country in high school (got offered a full ride scholarship for college basketball but decided to take the rodeo scholarship). I am a college student who's going to school for a master's in Criminal Justice with an emphasis in Corrections. I believe in strategizing and I am not afraid to push myself mentally and physically.[1]

Claim to Fame: Moving to New York from Wisconsin on a whim and I'm still here!
Inspiration in Life: My father, Royal Boehlke - he's one of a kind!
Hobbies: Horseback riding, sports, traveling and getting paid to talk.
Pet Peeves: New York men who cat call women as we walk by. I don't understand what that accomplishes.
3 Words to Describe You: Quirky, driven and fierce.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why: 1) Yoga mat – It could serve as tarp/blanket/world's shortest slip 'n slide. 2) Juggling balls filled with rice – I've always wanted this. 3) A Unicorn, but not one that could fly.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: I guess I'm a smidge like Stephenie LaGrossa when it comes to being a force in challenges and being a bit of a tomboy.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I can't really get myself to turn down a second adventure of a lifetime, so here I go again!
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: Besides having the outdoors stuff down, I now have one season under my belt and aim to come out of the gate swinging. I'm hoping all of the crazy people will target each other right off the bat.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: There's so much luck involved, but overall I am pretty good at making friends/alliances and can be pretty sneaky if I want to be. I plan to come out strong and aggressive in an all or nothing fashion and hopefully it works in my favor.[2]

Name: Michaela Bradshaw
Age: 25
Current residence: Fort Worth, TX
Occupation: Vacation club sales
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Intelligent, fun, and competitive.
Hobbies: Traveling, eating, and cuddling.
Pet peeves: When incompetent people try to instruct me, when people do things inefficiently or wrong, when I lose, and when other people make me lose.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? To be a Millennial is to resonate with the idea that I can design my own life. It's the notion that I should have the desires of my heart, not because I am ""entitled"" to them, but because God granted me the ability to attain them. Being a Millennial means I am bold enough to state a want and stubborn enough to work for it, despite obstacles and the opinions of others. It means that my journey is only a failure if I stop moving forward.
Personal claim to fame: Paying off my student loan debt is the crowning achievement of my twenties thus far. As a low-income student at a pricey suburban university, I worked two to three jobs during the majority of my college career, had very little fun, and made every decision based on money. When I graduated and began working as an admission counselor, I kept my expenses low by eating PB&J for lunch, denying myself cable and internet, sticking to my flip phone, and driving my 1992 Honda Accord. After years of being teased for my frugal ways, I got the last laugh when I paid off $31,000 in loans at the age of 23.
Inspiration in life: My godfather is my hero. He was about 60 years old when I was born. He had no children of his own and was the ultimate father figure in my life. For 20 years, he has read the Bible every day. When I was younger, he took care of me, showed me what to value in a man, and raised me to tell the truth, trust in God, be confident in myself, do my best, and not fear mistakes. His influence led me to be a magna cum laude college graduate. The person I am is because of him.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A mirror because I'll feel better if I can look better and I'll have no idea how I look if I can't see myself. A book because it will give me something to listen to besides myself and keep my mind sharp. Being alone and thinking too much drives people crazy. Finally, chocolate because sometimes a taste of something sweet can boost my mood.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I'd play like a combination of Tasha Fox (Cagayan, Cambodia), Kelley Wentworth (San Juan del Sur, Cambodia) and Natalie Anderson (San Juan del Sur). Tasha was in the right alliances and never had her loyalty questioned. I love that Wentworth was crafty, played hard, took risks, and was an asset in challenges. Natalie represents my inner beast; she was athletic, spunky, played a social game, made big moves, and actually won.
Reason for being on Survivor: My motivation is the $1 million. My goal is to leave an inheritance to my children's children. Winning Survivor would be a start.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will be the Sole Survivor because I will adapt to everything the game throws at me. My experience in sales has made me nearly immune to rejection, so things not going my way won't take my head out of the game. Physically, I'm in great shape. Also, I'm a fairly rational thinker, so I will separate what I do in real life from what I need to do to win this game.[2]

Name (Age): Aubry Bracco (29)
Tribe Designation: Brains

Personal Claim to Fame: My name (it means ""leader of the elves"") and the way I pursued my education with my own style. I convinced my advisors at Brown University to let me write a children's book about a manatee instead of a 50-page thesis and went on to graduate with honors.
Inspiration in Life: My grandmother, Madeline. She dealt with a crazy Brooklyn Italian family and was a hard worker. She was the first Woman of the Year at the New York Daily News and never let anything get her down (she once went back to work the day after a major car accident). She also had a wacky personality—as kids she told us she didn't eat chicken because ""their legs were too close to their butts.""
Hobbies: Crayon art, running, meeting locals in new places and astrology.
Pet Peeves: People who are not self-aware, don't know how to listen actively or give fake compliments. Close second: scented things covering bad smells.
3 Words to Describe You: Beguiling, intuitive and relentless.
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? 1. Crayons – (preferably a 64-pack with built-in sharpener) to hold an art therapy session to calm everyone down. Plus, they smell good. 2. Camera – to document the adventure. 3. Astrology books – I want to know who I'm dealing with and what motivates people.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Love child of Sophie and Cochran. Hair of Shambo.
Reason for Being on Survivor: I love Survivor. Since I was 15, I've watched. As complicated as the game is, there's something so simple, authentic and raw. I have deep respect for the timelessness and evolution of the game.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: I'm a hard worker who never gives up, and I'd entertain people by pulling a Greg Buis and being a weirdo. People would think I was doing this to be funny and pass time, but I'd actually be extracting key details. After living in Salem, MA during several Halloweens, I've learned to embrace my quirkiness and work with outlandish personalities.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I'm an expert listener and a journalist at heart so I'm inherently observant and social. I look for the most genuine and self-aware person in the room so I can connect with them, and I'm on the prowl for the most fake person in the room so I know what I'm dealing with. I want to prove to myself that I have what it takes to manage personalities under pressure with $1,000,000 on the line.[1]

Personal Claim to Fame: Being a part of the AIDS Life Cycle ride for the past 13 years. A 545-miles, 7-day camping and bicycle ride from SF to LA to benefit HIV and AIDS services. In total, I've raised over $75,000 for the LA LGBT Center and SF AIDS Foundation. I love this grueling, but fun, mental and physical challenging experience.
Inspiration in Life: My parents. They worked so hard to provide for 11 of my siblings. During and after the Vietnam war, we were so poor, we had to eat plain rice with soy sauce for months. Somehow they managed to get us all on a fishing boat to escape Communism and luckily we all survived 11 days on the open ocean. In an Indonesian refugee camp, my mom made and sold one cookie at a time to earn extra money for her children. They are the ones that taught me self-reliance and my mom always reminds me ""If you have health and both hands, you can never go to sleep cold or hungry.""
Hobbies: Planning dinner parties, cooking for friends and keeping bees. I am fascinated by the colony's social structures. I also enjoy reading and discussing fiction in our book club.
Pet Peeves: Foodies, double parked cars and lazy people.
3 Words to Describe You: Energetic, resourceful and competitive.
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Coffee-my life necessity, I grew up loving Vietnamese coffee since I was 3 years old; a razor- I like to shave my head and face to feel young (a survival must) and clean; ""The Windup Bird Chronicle,"" it's a surreal Japanese fiction that would relax me.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Spencer, I like his positive spirit and determination to survive in given situations, and Bob Crowley, because we're both older, nice, likable players with non-threatening demeanors who work hard.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Definitely, the fun of testing my ability to survive in harsh conditions, pushing my body physically and mentally to the fullest. I would love to compete in challenges against younger, stronger or bigger players to prove that size and age does not matter in this game. I believe in playing a good social game, and the nice guy always can win in the end. Also, to win the million dollars!
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: As a gardener and fishermen, I have the outdoor skills to build shelter, climb trees, forage for food, fish and dive. I am a vegetarian but I will harvest sea life for the tribe if it keeps me in the game. I will be useful and work hard at camp. I'm physically fit and will help win challenges. Being the middle child of 11 kids, I know how to get along and be the peacemaker. I can share my childhood war stories to pass time and charm people while bringing good spirit and harmony to the tribe.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: Growing up poor and without many of life's comforts, I have the physical and mental stamina to survive in harsh environments. I'm determined and never give up till I get what I'm after. I am short and non-threatening, most people seem to like me and often are drawn to me for whatever reason. I am genuinely nice and will treat everyone well (but don't cross me, not even once). I will do whatever it takes to become the Sole Survivor. Even though it'll be difficult and devastating to betray my alliance, my ultimate goal is to win. I want to be a winner that everyone thinks is a little odd, but endearing, who plays a smart and interesting game with some spicy drama.[2]

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I believe it's my destiny. Truthfully, because I believe 100% that Survivor was created for me. I've been waiting 10 years and nothing will stop me!

If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Teriyaki Sauce. Everything tastes better with teriyaki sauce. Next would be Takis (hot chili and lime flavor) because they are amazing and finally a pen and pad to document each play that made me Sole Survivor.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Joe from Season 30. He was a nice guy and knew how to use his social skills to make friends in the game. When he was backed against a wall, he fought as hard as he could to win every individual immunity and save himself. He wasn't a quitter and neither am I!
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My primary motivation is to win a million dollars! I'm a businessman and this is a business trip!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I believe that I can withstand the challenges in every facet.

Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I honestly don't think you will see gameplay like mine; one of the only things I have in common with people on past seasons is there was a winner.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Playing football has fed my drive to compete physically for a long time. Of course there are mental aspects but I feel like this is competing mentally, physically, and strategically. I also want to win on my own merit—no coaches, no practice—just me winning outside of something I've done for years.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Everything I've accomplished I've had to scratch and claw at it. I've never been given anything or put in situations to succeed. My life has always been about proving people wrong and I feed on that, here is another shot.[2]

What's your personal claim to fame? Obtaining my doctorate in Nursing before the age of 28 and creating a health and wellness brand ""Belovist.""
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Cliché – My parents. They both have devoted their lives to helping others. They have worked hard and excelled in education and careers—showing me that hard work pays off. They have shown me what true love means as well as the value of family and having a relationship with Christ. Even in my adult life, I remember the wisdom and lessons they've taught me while growing up, and it keeps this scattered mind of mine on point! They are my biggest fans, and I am theirs.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First it would be baby powder because it makes my hair do incredible things and brightens up the face. It's like taking a powder bath! Next would be a swiss army knife so I can cut things like wood, food, and clothes. Finally, a fishing pole because this girl likes to eat!
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Probably Andrea Boehlke. One of my biggest personality strengths is being likeable and able to entertain a crowd! I can relate to thinking that the world is at my fingertips, but really I don't like to compare myself to others. I just try to be my best self!

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am extremely physically and mentally resilient as well as disciplined. I am driven by failures, challenges, and goals. I don't react solely on ""good feelings."" When I sense there is something to be accomplished, my Type A personality comes out! In the same breath, my sanguine personality always stands out as being a super-social optimist, which will give me favor with the other players.

Three words to describe you: Congenial, forthright, and unremitting.
What's your personal claim to fame? I became an assistant professor at the age of 26 and a program director at the age of 27. They don't just hand out those titles to anyone.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My grandmother. A survivor of the Great Depression, the civil right's movement, a divorce, and her second husband's fatal illness, she demonstrated unmatched resilience, resolve, and compassion. But above all, she played as hard as she worked and literally lived each day to the fullest. In honor of her legacy, I attempt to live my life without regrets.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First would be Chapstick because there's nothing sexy or seductive about cracked lips (arguably, this could be survival related since it would hinder my ability to seduce the opposite sex). Second would be an unlimited supply of food because I've seen the show and those people get hangry quick! Finally, a masseuse because I love being pampered.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Tasha from Season 28. Though Tasha was casted for the ""brains"" tribe, she had the social skills of the beauty tribe and certainly the strength of the brawn tribe. She played a good game and was undoubtedly a fierce, physical competitor. I was able to relate to Tasha because I also think I'll be a physical, social, and cognitive threat.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Winning one million dollars! Professionally and personally, I don't love where I am and would be so grateful for a clear path out. I've also told the people close to me that I'd love to spend some time living out of a backpack, traveling, and showering only a few times a week... so being on Survivor would be a dream come true.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Charm, wit, beauty, mental fortitude, physical strength—all of these traits and more will ensure I'm the Sole Survivor. Already in good shape, I will show up on the island the strongest, quickest, most powerful and agile I've ever been. Borrowing from my childhood love of puzzles and games or logic and strategy, my mental sharpness will be at its peak.

Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Spencer from Season 28. He came across as a nerd or just a little awkward but he ended up being really dominant in challenges and in the mental/social game and that's how I see myself.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Of course the money would be incredible but I honestly think having the title of Sole Survivor is the ultimate accomplishment for an outdoorsman like me.

What's your reason for being on Survivor? Mo money baby! Of course the million dollars. I play ""survivor"" 40 hours a week at work. It would take me 10 plus years to earn a million dollars at my current work rate. Why not speed up the process and make a million in six weeks? It's a no brainer. In addition, I always tell my son that he needs to give 100 percent in everything he does. I'm constantly telling him ""go hard or go home."" I just want him to see that what I preach, I also apply to myself.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I can relate to people from all paths of life, I work in a diverse community with diverse backgrounds in age, religion, and social status.

Who or what is your inspiration in life? This whole world inspires me. Everywhere you look there is opportunity to make a change for the better and to really go out there and live the exact life you want to live. People get so caught up in the day to day that they forget that in each of us is the power to change. The way I see it, there's nothing stopping anyone who wants something bad enough from going out and making it happen; and if that thing doesn't work out, you learn, you grow, and you move on.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A surfboard to keep me sane, headphones to tune out other people's complaining, and a journal to secretly document everything and tactically plan how to use it against others.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Richard Hatch seemed to have the right idea, and because he won. I am a winner.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Life is WAY too short to not say YES to everything. My dad and I have wanted me to be on Survivor since Season 1—and I finally decided that I should stop messing around and go out and win a million bucks for myself and the family. I get super anxious when life starts to settle too much so I really needed another curve ball in life to mix things up a bit and this is certainly it.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? If you're not first, you're last—and I refuse to be last. I have never given up or settled for second best at anything in my life.

Hometown: North Arlington, N.J.
Current Residence: North Arlington, N.J.
Occupation: Bellhop
Hobbies: Watching sports, karaoke, and playing harmonica.
Pet peeves: Smoking, political correctness, and people who lack passion.
Three words to describe you: Witty, ambitious, and approachable.
What's your personal claim to fame? I've worked a lot of jobs, but I am most proud of my internships with both houses of Congress, and the British Consulate. I also aspire to attend law school.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning is my inspiration in life. His toughness is admirable, as he has never missed a game in his entire NFL career. He has a humble demeanor, and always takes responsibility if the team loses. Even though he has won two Super Bowls, he is continually critiqued, yet always acts with grace and humility. Eli has honestly provided me with some of the best moments of my life, so take that for what it's worth.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First I would bring a sports visor which will block out the sun as well as allow the top of my head to get an Island breeze, a McDonald's Shamrock Shake because they are seasonal so any opportunity I have to get one, I have to take, and a podium so I could give press conferences to pretend people care about what I have to say.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Todd Herzog, on Survivor: China, he had tremendous social skills and charisma; he was incredibly well-spoken and he was relatable enough to build bonds that lasted until the end. Similar to Todd, I think some of my abilities are underestimated by others.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I love the game. I have wanted to play this game since I was six years old. It's much more than a game to me, it's a passion, I obsess over it. Life does not give you many opportunities to test yourself like Survivor is designed to.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I feel like I can get along with a variety of different people because I have knowledge of different topics. Without question, I am there to win and I will use relationships to get to the end yet I will do it in a way that ensures I'm liked enough to get votes.[2]

What's your personal claim to fame? I've traveled through all seven continents! I'm proud of having graduated from Penn (as a math major!) and MIT. And mostly, I'm really proud of the three incredible humans that my husband and I have raised.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My husband and my children - they are just amazing in every way. Anyone who is afraid but goes for it anyway. Women in math.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A photo of my family since they'd get me through the super tough days, a blanket because I hate being cold, and tweezers.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Probably Tai Trang. He falls in love with everyone but gets cut-throat when he needs to. Or Spencer Bledsoe, who never gives up or stops looking for cracks.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? The adventure! But it's an adventure with a goal, and I am a super competitive, Type A overachiever. I will win!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am smart, lovable, and driven, and people like to help me, a combination that has led to great success. I get along with everyone, work hard, and always think ""I can do it!""[4]

Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I'm a mix of Russell Hantz, Boston Rob, and Joe Anglim. I'm a little conniving and manipulative like Russell, have the determination and confidence of Boston Rob, and the athletic ability of Joe.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Winning a million dollars and being on an island and living with nothing.

Hobbies: Paintball, working out, running, free diving, snorkeling, being in nature, anything involving the ocean, and I LOVE race/stunt cars drag race. Yes I'm a little bit of a tom boy and not at all ashamed.
Pet peeves: Complainers! People who feel entitled to everything without working for it. Also, annoying laughs, arrogant men, racism, bullies, and pretty boys.
Three words to describe you: Outspoken, strong-willed, and strategic.
What's your personal claim to fame? I was promoted to Senior Surgery Technician after only one year of long hours and sleepless nights of on call emergency surgeries. Meanwhile I was taking care of 14 foaling babies (horses) at home in exchange for rent.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Not to be the cliché but my mother, reasons being I would not be here if she decided to abort (which was highly recommended by her doctors due to health issues when pregnant with me), thanks for rebelling Mom! I am grateful for the woman she is and instilling in me the fighter I've become. She recently overcame skin cancer with a smile on her face. She's had to work hard and reconstruct her life after some health issues and losing close family members. She is a genuinely kind, graceful woman with fire in her heart. She works with handicapped children which has been a dream of hers. She reminds me I have a bigger purpose in life. I've always really appreciated her strong support in my way of thinking and encouraged me to keep being an extraordinary human being. In other words, having a strong personality and being weird is cool in her book. That normal is boring and with that, normal woman rarely go down in history. To always do everything in life wholeheartedly. It's an ""all or nothing"" kind of life in my mom's eyes. I couldn't agree more with that woman.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A small plush panda teddy bear my mom gave me. It's special because she calls it my guardian angel. It really is the little things in life. A small bottle of my dad's cologne. He is the one who always pushes me to do better than the best, to be tougher. Being able to smell his cologne will feel like he is right next to me talking words of wisdom and encouragement. I was always a daddy's girl, and most importantly I have this bracelet that says ""ONE MILLION WIN"" (cause Sole Survivor would be a bit too cheesy even for me). It's gold on black strings and it serves as my reminder of how bad I need to win Sole Survivor. I never take it off.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I would play like a combination of people. First would be Tony Vlachos who actually goes out and hunts for idols when no one's paying attention. Next would be to play challenges like challenge beast Kelly Wiglesworth. I'm also going to go for a nice little four win streak. Also, Brenda Lowe who can't help but be expressive, kind but is a total badass in challenges, and finally, Sandra who I can identify with socially in her sassy attitude and manipulative ways.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? One million dollars is a huge motivating factor for me. The bragging right of forever being a legendary Sole Survivor and being 1 of 16 women to win will be nothing short of amazing, but a million dollars is life changing! It would give me the freedom to be able to have a home and not continue to move from crappy apartment to crappy apartment. It would allow me to pursue investing and financial growth which I can turn into my lifelong goal of living a philanthropic life.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Because of my hell-bent determination and strong will to win. I put my heart into everything I do. I wanted to go to school, so I worked three jobs to pay for it, along with 1,000 hours of internships to graduate. In business I wanted to help my brother and we grew the business from one store to three stores. I know in my heart that I can win. I welcome all challenges with open arms and can read people really well. Socially, it'll be fun to test waters on how diverse I can be in order to really connect with people. After all, I have to cater to people's personalities so they'll feel comfortable doing what I need. Once my heart is set I will stop at nothing until I've achieved my goal even through blood, sweat, and tears. I've studied Survivor well enough to understand how to manipulate the numbers, play idols how they should be played and hustle the social game. I will go into this with focus, agility, and perseverance.[2]

Age: 22
Hometown: Merrick, New York
Current residence: Brooklyn, New York
Occupation: Music Teacher
Hobbies: Songwriting and performing those songs, telling stories—be that on stage or just to friends—and cooking with my mom. Shut up, it makes me happy! Also, I listen to a ton of podcasts, attend as many concerts as I possibly can, and spend a great deal of time panicking over current political events.
Pet peeves: When people let little discomforts spoil an entire experience. When people feel a need to complain constantly, even when there's nothing to complain about. The worst, though? When people don't have a sense of humor. Laugh, dammit!
Three words to describe you: Self-deprecating, charming, and affable—though others would say ""punchable.""
What's your personal claim to fame? Nothing feels better than hearing your own music for the millionth time and still enjoying it. And even better, when other people hear your music for the first time and it makes them cry. You can't fake those kinds of responses. It's the best. Cheesy? Maybe. True? You bet, man.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? I have a few but I suppose Robin Williams is the most well-known one. When I was a little kid, Genie from Aladdin was my entire sense of humor. That wild, a-hundred-jokes-a-minute pacing, all the voices and wackiness completely dazzled me. As I got older, I got to appreciate all his other amazing roles and unabashedly nutty stand-up routines. I'm often told I'm too loud. I blame that entirely on Robin Williams.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First would be my guitar because it gives me something I can focus on outside of the game. Next, one of those daily joke calendars because not only is it great for keeping track of time, but if your situation isn't providing many laughs, it's good to have a reliable way to find some. Finally, beard oil. I bought my first vile of this stuff about a year ago and it's the best feeling thing ever. Plus, it's really fun to respond to ""Are you wearing cologne?"" with ""No, just beard oil.""
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I've always felt like I related most to Stephen Fishbach, though I see a lot of David Wright in me as well. I'm a funny, nerdy, neurotic Jewish guy trying to make it in the entertainment business. I'm logical and smart (I like to think), but I've spent plenty of time crying in private.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I've been dreaming of doing this for well over a decade. At this point, above all else, it's to prove I can do what I've been saying I could do since I was a kid: Win Survivor. Part pride, part sticking it to the kids who tortured me growing up. It's a ""What have you accomplished?"" kind of thing. I promise I'm not usually so vengeful!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? This sounds stupid, but I'm really easy to talk to. I want to set up my situation so everyone knows they can come to me to chat and get support despite any problems they're having personally or socially in the game. I'm a teddy bear, y'know? On top of that, I'm not a weakling. I can haul firewood and follow instructions when it comes to building shelters. I know how to make fire and untie knots and all that.[2]

What's your personal claim to fame? Accomplishing my childhood dream of becoming a killer whale trainer at SeaWorld Orlando!
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My parents. They have been married for 32 years and have raised five successful, happy, and healthy children. They have stuck by each other's side through all the ups and downs over the years and have never given up on one another!
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Lip balm—I'm addicted—a space heater to keep me warm, and a super comfy pair of sweatpants.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Kelley Wentworth. She was strategic, strong, sneaky, and a fighter. She wasn't afraid to make big moves. She played her own game and didn't hide in anyone's shadow.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? It has always been one of my dreams to be on Survivor. I have been a fan of the show since Season 2 and I know I have what it takes to be the Sole Survivor. Additionally, I would love to see a new part of the world and a million dollars wouldn't be bad either.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Being resilient, strong, and fearless are nice traits that should translate well on the island. For example, at a younger age I was a competitive gymnast on the national level and sustained a career-ending injury. Doctors told me I would never compete again as a gymnast, nor play other sports. Fortunately, in high school, I went to state finals in volleyball and diving and then earned a D1 diving scholarship to the University of South Carolina. Go Gamecocks![2]

Pet peeves: Passive-aggression, when people slow down to merge or change lanes, cry babies, and waiting.
Three words to describe you: Deliberate, optimistic, and determined.
What's your personal claim to fame? I am not afraid to take risks and make big changes. During the recession, I left a well-paying but unsatisfying desk job, risking everything I owned, to start my own business. After more than a dozen years and at 40 years old, I sold the business to pursue another lifelong interest to become a teacher.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My wife because she overcame bike crashes, injuries, and big obstacles to become a world-class professional triathlete (while raising two kids and running a business).
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A picture of my wife and kids to keep me tethered to reality, a football to throw on the beach, and bacon jerky because it's delicious and doesn't need to be refrigerated.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Jeremy Collins and Tom Westman because I understand people and know how to unite them behind a common goal. Also, I am pretty athletic for an old guy.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? To win.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I'm strong, fast, tough, and good with my hands. I can read a room. I know how to make people feel comfortable and secure. My tribemates will want to keep me around.[2]

Pet peeves: When I run out of wine.
Three words to describe you: Wild, determined, and passionate.
What's your personal claim to fame? Ironman. I'm most proud of not just the finish line at the event but the dedication to the training as a working single mom that went behind it. It made me a better human and changed my kids and my life. My racing is always a family affair and I couldn't do it without my two little cheerleaders. Also, I've done a lot of solo traveling. I've been to 24 countries and six continents. Backpacking and trekking solo is a massive passion of mine and feeds my wanderlust soul. It is adventurous and crazy at times but it's shaped me more than anything else in life.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Bob Scott. 87 years old. He is my angel. I met him the week of my divorce and two weeks after his wife passed away. I like to think his angel wife brought us together. He taught me to swim shortly after we met because he wanted me to be a ""happy and fit mom"" for my boys. He helped me learn to ride a triathlon bike. He introduced me to the world of triathlon, which changed my world. He competed alongside me at my first half Ironman and full Ironman and still competes to this day. Bob taught me the sport is about fun, fitness, and friends and that to do this for life and be just like him, I had to keep this mentality. We still train together each week as well as compete alongside each other.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Lipstick! Because I even wear it when I do my Ironman races! Next would be ear plugs because I'm an insanely light sleeper and hate snorers, and a piece of Rose Quartz because it's my favorite stone and would remind me to follow my heart and trust my intuition.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? A combo of Parvati for her heart and inner strength, Tyson for his sarcasm, Ozzy for his love of adventure, Courtney for her sass, and Mama C for being a strong and fierce mom.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? The adventure. I've watched every single episode of Survivor since it began 18 years ago and the adventure of the show keeps me coming back for more and applying over and over and over! And the social game! I have wanted to play the social game since the first season. Ever since I taught English in Russia in college and was dropped into Siberia with a random mix of girls I have loved the social game of learning to get along with people in a group setting and finding out what makes people tick. That's why I love traveling solo too, because I like to meet and connect with other people from different beliefs and backgrounds.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Because every day for the past 10 years, I have looked at a sticker on my mirror: ""Outwit, Outlast, Outplay. Survivor."" I never once have stopped believing that this dream would come true. I can have all the strategy in the world and I will! But if I have learned anything from watching the show, participating in endurance events, raising children, working in a fast-paced finance position, studying in an ashram, being an entrepreneur, or all my other adventures is that nothing turns out like you expect. I am really good at adapting to circumstances, to people, and to unlikely situations. Plan A quickly becomes Plan C and it doesn't shake me up. I can endure pain both mental and physical with a smile on my face. Adaptation. A sense of humor. Dreaming big. That embodies who I am and why I will win![2]

Three words to describe you: Astute, resolute, and ambitious.
What's your personal claim to fame? I am a U.S. Presidential Scholar selected by President Obama's commission, and interned for his White House administration. In college, I was a walk-on sprinter for Harvard Track and Field and, as a senior, was elected team captain by my teammates, becoming the first Asian American captain in program history.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My grandfather came from a rural village in Korea, survived the Korean War, put himself through the best college in the country, and eventually became a successful businessman. He came from nothing to overcome tremendous odds and so much adversity and always exemplified love for family along the way. He passed away a couple of years ago but remains an inspiration in everything I do.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First, a photo of my family. They'll be a source of emotional strength no matter how tough it gets out there. Second would be an American flag because being a first-generation American is one of the greatest sources of pride and willpower for me. Finally, a journal and pen to take notes on the game as it develops and also to keep a diary during the adventure of a lifetime.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Yul Kwon. Our backgrounds are uncannily similar as Korean-American management consultants, and I plan to follow his example in being cool, calm, and collected throughout the game. Yul's Survivor journey contributed greatly to the positive representation of Asian-Americans on TV, and I hope to do the same.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Survivor is an adventure like no other. Everything it presents—the wilderness, the challenges, the fellow castaways from all cross-sections of America—will be a chance for me to break out of the bubble I've been a part of for most of my life and push myself physically, emotionally, and mentally like never before. I'll embrace the challenge and have fun along the way.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? There is no magic formula to winning Survivor. However, there are qualities that will help players get far. I believe I have most of them—I am team-oriented, athletic, outgoing, and tenacious. I will focus on being a helpful, likable asset to those around me, and on the down low strategically pave my path to the very end.[2]

What's your personal claim to fame? Getting on Survivor. But really, I am most proud of getting into UCLA Law, one of the best law schools in the country. Additionally, making it through the first year of law school taught me a lot about drive and perseverance.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? I don't have a particular source of inspiration in life because I don't believe in emulating or worshipping anyone. I think that everyone has positive traits to draw from as well as less desirable aspects.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First, a notebook and pen to organize my thoughts and strategy. Second, my retainers because I have had my braces off for over a decade but am still too scared to try not wearing them. What if my pearly whites started moving around? And finally, a bottle of rum because no self-respecting sailor would be caught on a remote island without rum.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I am passionate, competitive, and neurotic like Spencer. Also, I have the same penchant as him for making people feel irrelevant and that is something I will have to be very careful not to do during the game.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? To take a shot at playing a game I have watched religiously and loved since I was 9. I'd also like to win the million so I can pay off my student loans and then buy a sailboat and sail around the world.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I like to lead people and take initiative. Plus, I like to roast people and what doesn't build tribe morale more on Survivor than a few laughs from roasting the other tribe? I can also cook a mean batch of rice.[3]

Pet peeves: My pet peeves are certain characteristics of people. If you are lazy and also a liar, I won't like you. In fact, it angers me when people act lazy and try to manipulate everyone around them and ruin everything. Now, those pet peeves are going to be alive and well in the land of Survivor. Good thing I know how to dish it right back. I have been around people like that my whole life and I know how to deal with it. So yeah, my title of Most Dramatic, in the face of a bunch of liars will be, shall we say... interesting.
Three words to describe you: Ambitious, charismatic, and charming.
What's your personal claim to fame? My greatest accomplishment was being on a 5th Avenue Versace billboard! It was by no means the end all and be all of where I want to be in life, but it was a major accomplishment. To me it was an accumulation of everything I've worked hard for finally getting justified. It was a huge symbol of perseverance and it was gratifying. I rely on my own self-motivation and have accomplished stuff that was difficult and took legit perseverance, but winning Survivor will top all that.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My ma is my hero. But it wasn't always so. Growing up, my mom and I didn't have the best relationship. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 27 and had me at 34. God bless her. A lot of side effects of MS don't just affect the body, but the brain as well, such as depression. So as a kid, I couldn't handle or understand what was going on. I look back at my childhood and most memories of my mom and I were difficult. She would have seizures during my baseball games, at my school where she tutored, and the side effects of all the medications made it difficult to have a normal relationship with her. When I was 12, my parents split and the next couple years were even tougher as her disease progressed. If it wasn't for my father telling me I needed to rise above the past and grow up, I would have continued to struggle. When I was told she had two months to live I decided to become a man at 17, and our past struggles brought us even closer. Through the years, our relationship grew, and our love and respect for each other brought our relationship to all-time highs. None of this would be possible if she hadn't beat the odds for almost 10 years now. I will always idolize her perseverance, her grit, and her faith in God. She is the greatest hero anyone can have and I live through her. She never quit or gave in when she was told she had two months to live, so why should I ever quit or give in when life ""gets hard?"" Want to talk about a survivor? That's my mom.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First would be a good luck necklace my mom gave me when she almost died. I've been wearing it ever since and crazy good things have happened since. Also, lotion, so I could give awesome massages and bond with the hot girls on my tribe, and finally a second bottle of lotion—I plan to be on the island for a while, and maybe I'll get one if I play my cards right!
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? From Season 33, I would be a mix of Ken and Michaela. I would provide food like Ken. But unlike Ken, my social game would be on point. I would have Michaela's fire, determination, and athletic ability. I would also be blunt like her, but would do a better job of building relationships. In previous seasons, I would have the social and ladies game like Joe. Joe is eye candy and smooth. I would try and form a coalition with someone like him. He would be my shield and then I would cut him later in the game. As far as Season 36, I won't know whether to play the game like a Florida panther—stealthy and in the shadows, or like a lion—dominating its tribe. I may have to be both, depending on the dynamic of the game.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? The game itself, and to spread the awareness of MS. 2.3 million people worldwide have MS and there is no cure! For me, like life, I've been finding ways to survive for a long time. I want to apply all my experiences with different personalities, and put them to the ultimate test. I want to compete and I want to win. This is a competition of survival. I am a type-A personality and I cannot stand the thought of losing. I have tunnel vision when it comes to winning and there is nothing out there, competition wise, like Survivor.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will bring my Survivor mental toughness, my ability to adapt, my positivity to aid the weak, and my will to survive. I might not know how to do some things, but I will find a way to eat and get water. Whether that's through my creativity, my charm with women, or my ability to make one of the guys my bro. Some men will not like my alpha mentality, which strategically, I will hold back in the beginning as I read people, but I will find my way. They always say ""don't bite the hand that feeds you."" I grew up on an island so if I'm one of the few that can get his own catch and get his own water (which are the two essentials of living), no one will bite that hand. I will have ultimate power.[2]

Pet peeves: When people don't put away simple belongings, loud chewing, and slow walkers.
Three words to describe you: Adventurous, strong, and outgoing.
What's your personal claim to fame? Training and completing a marathon! I tried while I was in Florida and my coach was in Texas. Crossing that finish line faster than my goal time was an incredible feeling.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Elisabeth Filarski-Hasselbeck. I began to look up to Elisabeth when I first saw her on Survivor when I was 9 years old. Even at a young age, I looked up to her not only because of her outer beauty, but her noticeably beautiful heart and work ethic. I continued to follow her in all aspects of life, from standing up for her beliefs to working with people who stand on her same side. I am a strong believer in my faith and when it comes to politics, let's just say I'm a true southern girl. She is a badass blonde, but shows that her faith and family come first. To be able to balance all of that like she does makes her a hero and a mentor to me.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? My Bible because my faith is everything, a baseball hat, and a huge bag of my family's smokehouse Turkey Jerky.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I would play a combination of Jenna Morasca and Kim Spradlin, and a little bit of Natalie White. Jenna because of her strategy to flirt to the finish. She wasn't afraid of much and used her strengths like beauty, social and brains to get her to the top. Kim because of her ability to keep cool when necessary and her athletic ability was on point. Natalie, because she used her southern outgoing charm to win hearts and keep her social game strong.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? To win a million dollars. And to prove that this southern small town blonde is more than just a pretty face. I love adventure. I love challenges and I love to overcome them. Winning could be my chance to show the bullies in high school that I'm not little 'ol Libby anymore. It's a chance to show off my skills and strengths and use them to their full potential. Being on Survivor has been a dream of mine. I feel like God's been putting me through challenges and experiences in life to prepare me for this.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Because I know that I can outlast and outplay! I work out a lot. I have endurance, I danced for 12 years. I have balance. I've completed tough mudders, marathons, and other races so I can get myself through challenges. My social game is strong. Making friends and alliances wouldn't be an issue for me. Though I now work with technology and digital media, I grew up camping, hunting, and fishing. I love the outdoors so I know I can use that experience and those skills to outlast those 39 days. I'm strong, smart, and pretty and I know how to use it.[2]

Hobbies: Traveling, debating, and binging on YouTube videos.
Pet peeves: Complaining.
Three words to describe you: Unbreakable, driven, and real.
What's your personal claim to fame? Getting a place and back on my feet after being homeless. Freshman year when school ended, I didn't have anywhere to go. My parents were in Nigeria and both my brothers were in the U.S. but not much older than me so they couldn't help. This resulted in me being homeless for 1–2 months.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Beyoncé. She works so hard and is constantly topping herself. She literally sets the standard for every performer and artist and continues to raise the bar. She had Adele and Kanye West on stage defending her when she didn't win an award. Who else can do that? She is one of the few super humans to walk the Earth.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A picture of a skeleton in a grave to constantly remind me that things could be worse, a photo book of my family because I will always love them and they forever motivate me and finally, text message threads between me and my best friend. We have the funniest conversations and laughing is the best way to stay positive and happy.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Michaela! I am a strong black woman who is not afraid to make power moves. I haven't had an easy life and sure as hell don't expect winning Survivor to come easy. I relate a lot to her because we are both strong-willed and determined and willing to do what it takes to accomplish our goals.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? The million dollars would change my life drastically. I would have a story for the books—the girl that went from village to Versailles. I've seen it all, from the slums to the fast-paced, hard working student life in NYC. I want to change my life and my surroundings. I want to show myself and others that regardless of what you've been through, (it was being homeless for me), you can succeed.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I currently live in a house of eight girls. I know how to deal with seven different versions of crazy and different personalities. I am constantly settling issues in the house and running the house meetings, not only does this make me sociable, it makes me likable and adaptable. I have good experience in sports, having played basketball for most of high school and I work out at my college gym. I'm putting myself through school with grants and academic scholarships while my parents are in Nigeria and I am an asset to any team.[2]

What's your personal claim to fame? I feel the most fulfilled when I can make someone's day or even make them smile. I think it's important to not only maintain healthy relationships with friends and family, but also to make a difference in a total stranger's life. I don't care what type of person you are, seeing someone better off because of something you did changes you for the better. Pay it forward, people. Even the smallest gesture can make a large impact!
Who or what is your inspiration in life? I'd say my daily hopes and dreams are inspired by all of the unique creatures, cultures, and nature that surrounds us on this planet.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First, lemons to flavor my water/food and bleach my hair. Second would be Mentos gum to chew, and finally, pen and paper to document my journey/write love letters to a hot castaway.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Because why the hell not? Literally can't think of a single reason why anyone would say no to an experience of a lifetime. Life is too short to not say ""YES.""
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have been able to manifest anything and everything I've ever wanted in my life—it's pretty cool. Not to brag, but I say I want something and I always get it. So hopefully by saying ""I'll survive,"" I will win or at least come out of the experience with nothing but a profound appreciation of what I just accomplished.[2]

What's your personal claim to fame? Graduating college. I grew as a person and learned a lot about dedication and self-motivation. It gave me the foundation to continue my education and pursue a career as a physician assistant.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My family. I have the most supportive and loving family. They constantly challenge me to be the very best version of myself. I love being able to pursue my passions and dreams knowing they will always be there to help me along the way.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A mattress to get a good night's rest, a toothbrush because I can't imagine not brushing my teeth for more than a day, and definitely food because nobody likes starving.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Parvati. I think I could use my charm to build relationships, and I think I have the competitive spirit and wit she had.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? It is the experience of a lifetime. You get to push yourself to your absolute limits and challenge yourself in a unique way. I believe I will learn a lot about myself and become a stronger person physically and mentally. The money would of course be helpful as well. I am looking to attend graduate school in the near future and it would be nice to not have any student loans after school.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have the traits needed to make me successful. I am a hard worker who is extremely driven to reach my goals.

Three words to describe you: Empathetic, effervescent, and excitable.
What's your personal claim to fame? My ever-evolving career. From being a waitress in Indiana, working at a plant nursery in Florida, to a receptionist at a crematory, and eventually working in career services and business consulting with a dual MBA and Master of Public Health.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My parents. My dad is one of the hardest working people I know. My mom tutors incarcerated women, volunteers on Election Day, and contributes to our local community in a loving, selfless way.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A bag of Skittles. I'm addicted to candy and just one Skittle a day would keep me going through starvation! Next, a deck of cards so I could get people to play games that require deceit, and try to read tells, and tampons, because, duh.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I hope I'm a mix between Kelley Wentworth and Aubry Bracco. Kelley is a badass game player who would do anything to win. She gets people to trust her and is still a snake. I'm also a little bit Aubry—strategic, very intuitive, but slightly neurotic and quirky.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? As Probst says, Survivor is a human experiment. I am fascinated, as a huge fan, to watch how people interact and deceive when pushed to their limits. Can't wait to have a front row seat! I want to prove to myself that I can take on this insane physical and mental challenge. Survivor is the greatest game on earth, and I'd like to try my hand at it.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will survive because of my innate ability to make people feel comfortable. I don't give up.

Three words to describe you: Outgoing, adventurous, and free spirited.
What's your personal claim to fame? Being everyone's favorite person. I truly enjoy meeting people from various walks of life, becoming very good friends with them, keeping them in my life, and smiling the entire way.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Bob Marley. That man knew how to live life. He understood what living meant and inspired people to love the life you live and live the life you love. I smile just thinking about that beautiful human.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A waterproof camera. Life is an adventure. I'm in love with memories. I really enjoy capturing every twist and turn this beautiful life has to offer. A Hawaiian sling. I am a waterman, so being in the water, hunting for food is where I feel the most at home. True peace for my soul. A big bowl of gummy candy. I am absolutely addicted to candy, especially gummies. I can catch the meat, but I can't catch the candy.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Tyson. He knew how to play the game through laughter, creativity, and good times. A true free spirit.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I've been waiting my entire life for an opportunity to show the world the many skills I have to offer. I feel like this is my calling. Also, almost everyone I know literally asks me all the time, ""Seb, why are you NOT on Survivor?"" I just feel like it's my time to shine.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am perfect for this game. I spend most of my life outside in the elements, a lot of which is involved with something physical. I'm great with people and can make friends very easily. I enjoy being challenged in such ways that may be life risking. I can figure out little kinks to situations that others may not even think about.[2]

It is D-O-N-A-T-H-A-N, not Jonathan or Donovan.
Three words to describe you: Determined, whimsical, and rare.
What's your personal claim to fame? I was a part of a national and state level winning dance team. I danced in the hip-hop routine. I am proud of being openly gay and dancing in front of thousands in this area. My goal is always to try to change the opinions of others when it comes to the LGBTQ community and through dancing, I was able to open the arms of many. There will never be another me when it comes to those years and for that impact, I feel very accomplished. Being the only guy to hold a national championship among the basketball, football and baseball guys—yeah, that felt really nice!
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My hero is my grandmother, Deloris Bentley. Always has been, always will be. My grandmother had seven children between the years of 1960-1968, with my mom being the youngest. She raised them all with very limited food, no power until 1975, no bathrooms, only outhouses—all while dealing with the day-to-day struggles of having an alcoholic as a husband. Over the years, things got better for her. She raised her children, divorced and re-married (twice), and ended up being very independent and open-minded! In 2006, she had a brain aneurysm. She flew out to have emergency surgery and you know what saved her that time? Her blood was so thick from smoking three packs a day for so many years, that the aneurysm was sealed shut. After her surgery, she was up the next morning eating on some ice. Now if that isn't inspiring, I don't know what is! She has always been the glue in our family. She is such a hero in my eyes because of all the sacrifices, determination and selflessness she has expressed and shown all her life! Many people are probably picking celebrities and all that jazz, but my little 'ole Maw Maw is my hero.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? My cross necklace my grandmother got for me, my glasses (if that counts) so I can snap them in half to help with making fire, and just the clothes on my back.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? While there are tons of castaways that I have related to, especially those from the LGBTQ community (Colton, Todd, Tai), and my hillbillies (Keith, Sandy, JT), I always find the most relatable to be Cirie. No one expected the gameplay Cirie played in her first season. She went out there, hated leaves, and really didn't know much about the game. But you know what? She went out there and learned the way. She kept her mouth shut when need be, made the big moves when she needed to, and had a great sense of the people on the island what they were thinking. She is the type of player I see myself being. I adore her, and it doesn't hurt that her birthday is July 18 and mine July 19. We Cancers just have a way about us that is charming, yet manipulative. Our knife is always ready for backs (figuratively)!
What's your reason for being on Survivor? It's for me and my family. We have always been below the poverty line. We have always struggled year to year to make ends meet. But it does make you stronger having to live that way. But you know what? I am tired of living this life. I want to be a great influence for my family—prove to them that when you try, things can happen. It takes you to put the first foot in the door, no one else. I don't want to end up being stuck here in a rusted old trailer. I want more for my family, especially my mom and grandmother, and also help those in my area who are less fortunate.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Living in Eastern Kentucky has its perks. We are outdoors people. We love the lakes, we love to roam trails and mountains, and I have learned a lot about nature and survival. And while I have never been in a dire situation to use these skills, I truly believe when the survivalist in me kicks in, I would have a lot to offer. Now darlin', I ain't no lumberjack. But I can offer common sense solutions in order to help make my tribe grow. I already plan on breaking my glasses to help with fire and prove that this little gay hillbilly nerd isn't afraid of what nature can bring! I really think I will surprise a lot of people.[2]

Pet peeves: My pet peeves are laziness or unmotivated people when they have the ability and or resources to be and do so much more, and when someone expects someone else to pull their weight. One that believes things are ""rights versus privileges."" Also, unorganized people or things, close-minded individuals and people who think you ""owe"" them something.
Three words to describe you: Spontaneous, courageous, and determined.
What's your personal claim to fame? Retirement from the U.S. Army. I served over 21 years in the Army and I was an Army officer captain. I served in the transportation unit and in a psychological Operations Battalion as an executive officer and I was the only female officer in the organization, yet still chosen to be second in command. I have been to several countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Dubai, France, Bratislava, Slovakia, Italy, and Germany. I was put in the most unusual and extreme situations and conditions and survived better than most. I was in isolated conditions where life's bare necessities were limited. While deployed to Iraq in 2003-2004, I went months with only taking bottle water showers. The supply lines were compromised so often I was forced to make a decision to either wash with my daily bottled water or consume it. I jumped from several different Military aircrafts and did drown-proofing that consisted of water survival. While deployed to Afghanistan, I was put in situations that required me to influence the local ""elders"" (leaders) of our U.S. missions in their country while at the same time earning their trust. This posed a huge issue because one, I am a female (and their beliefs with females are VERY different than ours) and two, I was an American. However, I was able to gain the trust of the local people as well as many elders.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My son. He has been braver than he believes, stronger than he seems, and smarter than he thinks. I have never met a more amazing person than him.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First would be my guitar because I have one and played a little in college but it would be a chance for me to have music and learn at the same time. Next would be paper and pen to document my experience. My memory is not the best and I want to capture as much as possible to remind me of the once in a lifetime experience I had. Finally, an iPod to listen to music.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Michaela Bradshaw because not only was she fit, outspoken, attractive, and witty, she also spoke her mind and was extremely good at challenges. And when she won, she wasn't afraid to celebrate. She expressed her emotions on her face which is very similar to me. My friends tell me even when my mouth is shut, they know what I am saying because my facial expression ""talks."" I'm not afraid to express my feelings and I put a lot out there. I want to give my best self and Michaela never gave up. It was clearly depicted in the episode where she lost her top. I'll do whatever it takes to win, with or without my top.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? To fulfill an exciting and different adventure that a small percent of people get to do. I want to be part of the small group that was chosen and is remembered. Not because everyone can, or everyone gets chosen or remembered. I will be the person everyone remembers because of my unique skills and plays I will bring.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am strong, hardworking, loyal, determined, and able to figure out most things. I am very versatile and by my looks, most wouldn't expect it. I am like the snake that you don't know is there until bitten. I have a strong ability to win people over and get them to want to do what I want just by actively listening.[2]

Who or what is your inspiration in life? My parents—for their dedication, support, and all the values they instilled in me.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?

Three words to describe you: Calculated, intuitive, and empathetic.
What's your personal claim to fame? My greatest personal accomplishment came when my first daughter was born in 2008. Before her birth I was very overweight, smoked cigarettes, dabbled quite a bit at the craps table and would most likely be sitting down at the poker table on any given day. I recall a specific moment when my daughter was about a year old and she wanted me to take her outside on the swings. It was chilly that day so I had to dress warm. While putting on my shoes, I recall panting from being out of breath from the simple act of tying my own shoes. It was at that moment that I knew I had to make a change so that I would be around a long time for her and my other children that were soon to come. In the last seven years, I quit smoking, dropped 65 pounds and even though I can still occasionally be found in a poker room, I have dramatically prioritized where my income goes and where most of my money is spent, which is primarily bills and workout clothes for my wife.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My father. He raised nine kids on a construction salary, taught his boys to be men and his daughters to be ladies.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A photo of my wife, a picture of my rugrats because they're awesome, and an antihistamine, which I will spike in somebody's drinking water if they are relentlessly annoying me and/or the group on the island.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I know you are looking for one, but I am going to split this in three. Mostly Cirie, because I think she is masterfully empathetic with other players. She has an amazing ability to disable people. I hope I can do what she has done in the game. Second is Cochran. He wins in the emotional intelligence category that allows him to morph into whatever he needs to at the time. He also understands the importance of stroking other people's egos when he needs to. This is something I hope I am capable of doing. And finally Rob Mariano, for the simple fact that we both come from Italian families with a background in construction. But more importantly, he sees the game big picture which is critical and I hope I can maintain.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Obviously this is the opportunity of a lifetime to play this game, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take a forced break from real life. And I don't mean that I am happy to leave my family or my job, but this game will force me to be away from my life for a set period of time which I hope will open my eyes to what's important when I get home. Oh yeah, and that money is mine!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I grew up in a house with eight siblings. Lack of food, clothes, and showers are something I'm accustomed to. This game should be a walk in the park.[2]

Who or what is your inspiration in life? My family. I'd do anything for them or to make their lives better.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First, my brush to take care of my beautiful beard and fro. Second, a chainsaw so I can make building things a lot easier, and finally, a sketchbook so I can doodle, draw, and write.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I think I'd play the game like Jeremy Collins because I'll always keep my heart in the right place, but I'll still be a serious competitor and threat.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I've been a big fan for a while, and I've always wanted to push myself to the limits and see if I can really survive. Oh yeah, I'm playing for the million bucks, too. That would really help things.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I'm good with people and likable. I'm very diplomatic and can connect with people from different walks of life.

Who or what is your inspiration in life? My dad is my hero. He worked two jobs when we were young to support a family of six, while my mother was confined to a hospital bed from an accident.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A picture of my wife and kids. They are what make me tick. That's all I need. They are my everyday motivation.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Cochran because he is a chameleon, like me. Hatch because he's a true-to-life person.

Pet peeves: Not saying ""bless you"" when someone sneezes, people who chew with their mouth open, and people who interrupt while others are talking.
Three words to describe you: Outgoing, positive, and motivated.
What's your personal claim to fame? When I was selected to be part of this game at such a young age. Some people have waited years to have this opportunity and I'm blessed to be able to participate in something that is so meaningful to me, as well as millions of others around the country.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Stephenie LaGrossa. Growing up I always admired her for her performance in her season. During Guatemala, she showed such determination, drive, and positivity. My goal in life is to stay positive no matter the situation. I believe life is all about how we react to situations, not the situation itself. My goal is to always take a step back, and evaluate what should come next.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? My toothbrush because thinking about going 39 days without clean teeth makes me cringe. My pillow so I can have some sense of comfort. My Bible because my relationship with the Lord is extremely important to me, so having that there with me during this experience would mean a lot.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? My goal as I go in is to play most like Sarah did in Game Changers. She had a phenomenal social game and I feel as if I can do the same thing because of the relationships I normally build with people. While doing that I can still balance camp life, and hopefully make it as far as she did.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My reason for being on the show is mainly the experience itself. I've grown up watching and loving Survivor. Never in a million years would I think I'd be participating in such an amazing life experiment. I am determined to push myself and see how strong I can be. I'm also excited to win a million dollars, that would be so life changing for myself and my family.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I'll survive because I feel I'm extremely adaptable. I'm able to think fast, and make decisions when needed. I also have a lot of knowledge about the game itself and I don't think people will expect that. I thrive when I'm being underestimated and I feel like in this game ""the young blonde"" is easily looked over.[2]

What's your personal claim to fame? Passed the bar in New York, New Jersey, and Georgia on the first try.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? I don't really have a hero, but I admire Oprah's ability to relate to people.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? Photo albums. Life means very little without your memories and the people you love to share them with. Liquor. And a friend, because it's a remote location.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Jeremy Collins. My personality will not allow me to fly under the radar, but I think my honesty and humor can take me for as long as I make a strong partnership.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I've been a fan for so long. I want to have the adventure first hand. I want to become the Sole Survivor and win the money so I can care for my sick father at home.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I believe I have an uncanny ability to read people well and gain their trust. I am also not hindered by what others back home will think of me, so I hopefully won't be afraid to make big moves.[2]

Pet peeves: People who complain constantly.
Three words to describe you: Strong, smart, and funny.
What's your personal claim to fame? If I were to choose one accomplishment I'm most proud of, it would have to be my debut victory. I was the underdog. I took on an opponent much more experienced than I was for my first fight. I beat her and retired her. I also gained my nickname and fan base after that victory. I've had 22 victories after that, but that one I'm most proud of.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My sister Twee. She is resilient and hard working. She was in college tutoring calculus while learning English and graduated top of her class.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? I would bring one of my favorite books, probably one about mental strength. I would also bring underwear. Lastly, I would bring a hair tie, because my hair is a pain.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Ben from Season 35. I am physically strong, assertive, but quiet and observant as well.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My first season I watched was Season 35, Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers. I thought I could definitely dominate this experience and win. If I would've seen this show earlier, I would've applied years ago.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am an elite athlete. I would win many challenges and would be a great asset to the team. I was born and lived in rural Vietnam until I was 9 years old so my natural survival skills are impeccable. I've sold cars for a living and can convince people of what they want and need. Being a fighter, I'm a great strategist. Before a fight, besides the physical training, we watch and study film on our opponents to assess and strategize how to defeat them. Most of all, I am adaptable.[2]

Hometown: Irvine, California
Current residence: Irvine, California

Hobbies: Fitness, reading, and game nights with friends and family.
Pet peeves: Number one for me is if people do not clean their teeth properly. It is the first thing I look at when I talk to people and sometimes it looks like a person hasn't brushed their teeth in days. What is that life? I also do not like when people stand too close to me in lines and people who tap their feet loudly. If I can feel the table moving because of your foot then there is a problem.
Three words to describe you: Confident, charismatic, and blunt.
What's your personal claim to fame? I am driven and persistent when I take on a task and those qualities are what helped me pursue my degree in Engineering. It was not an easy path to take and even though I dealt with personal challenges, I continued to stay focused on my goal.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My dad because he left Jordan to come to the U.S. when he was 18 years old with no parents or friends, yet he managed to become very successful for his family. He inspires me to be strong and to always strive to be better.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? A blanket to keep me warm at night. Binoculars so I could creep on people strategizing out in the ocean. Maybe I'll find out I have a secret talent of reading lips. A toothbrush because whenever I see contestants cleaning their teeth with twigs I cringe. I could care less if I smell nasty. Now, if my teeth aren't clean, I know I will be disgusted.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Kelley Wentworth because even though she kept finding herself at the bottom, she took all the necessary steps to get further in the game. I am not your stereotypical engineer and that drives me to prove people wrong and succeed in life.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? To WIN! I love Survivor and I have wanted to be on the show from the moment I saw it as a kid. I've seen every episode and always imagined what it would be like if I was one of the contestants. It wasn't until recently when I saw Jeff at a Survivor event that the opportunity seemed realistic. I got him to take a quick selfie and then told him I would be on the show, and of course I had to make it happen after that. It will be challenging, but that is the best part. It's going to make winning so much more rewarding.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I believe I will be the final Survivor because not only am I good at reading people, but I know how to get what I want. I know how to work people into doing things for me and that could help me make big moves in the game.[2]

Age: 57
Hometown: Los Angeles
Current residence: Los Angeles
Occupation: Publishing CEO
Hobbies: Roller skating, traveling (live concerts and plays), and creating things (natural skincare, soaps, cleansers).
Pet peeves: People who are negative; people who talk too much and listen too little; people who tend to say no before they consider ""the yes;"" people who are quitters as they are too lazy, ignorant, or a combination thereof to do better; people who lack motivation but want others to make things happen for them; sagging pants on young men; when my employees make silly errors that cost me revenue and lastly, when people sign up for things and are not fully committed, thereby negatively impacting results. That's all... not much.
Three words to describe you: Competitive, decisive, and persistent.
What's your personal claim to fame? My family, particularly my children and who they are as human beings, followed by my business and entrepreneurial conquests which include: becoming the first African-American at the L.A. Times (LAT) to be a Dual-Director as Director of Inside Sales at LAT and Director of Advertising for the Recycler, a separate L.A. Times-owned media business; launching the largest black-owned circulating newspaper on the west coast, Our Weekly; and starting my e-commerce business, a natural and organic skincare line, Kalaiaah.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My mother. She was an amazing person, incredibly courageous, authentic, striking woman who raised her family in the church and struggled to shield us from gangs, drugs, and violence while living in the heart of South Central LA. She was ""Big Momma"" to many and transitioned in September 2015.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? Sunglasses will give me the ability to see things, while hiding my eyes. A body pillow can serve as a mini mattress, warmth, and comfort. A swiss knife; it does it all... right?
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? It's very hard to pick only one, but I would say Kim Spradlin. I operate a lot like Kim as we are logical, strategic, and calculating but I'd like to think I would bring more excitement to the game as that season was a bit predictable.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I love to do over-the-top challenging things that are totally outside of my norm, especially if someone says or expects that I cannot do it. I don't want people to ever think that I am predictable or for them to categorize me in restrictive ways. I have accomplished many things in life that my friends and family will not and often cannot do and yet they live vicariously through me and my sharing experiences and that is priceless. My other motivation is that Survivor is my dream come true adventure that I know I can absolutely win. To have the opportunity to compete and then to become the Sole Survivor and win the money, is like actors who make a living ""acting,"" live glamorous lives and can then be rewarded Best Actress/Actor at the Oscars.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am analytical, logical, calculating, strategic, and can read people well even when they are not openly sharing. I am a young 57-year-old with great energy and people often guess my age to be 10–15 years younger than I am. I understand the game and have always been a risk taker. I am not afraid to make big moves. I am a strong competitor in all that I do. I got this.[1]

Hobbies: Kickboxing, writing, and drawing.
Pet peeves: I can't stand a dirty kitchen, people that won't stop talking about themselves, and unnecessary continuous noises.
Three words to describe you: Overachiever, funny, and resourceful.
What's your personal claim to fame? Going back to school and making it to grad school.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My hero is my mom, but please don't tell her! She went back to college after 40 years, completed her undergrad with a dual concentration and graduated Cum Laude way before I did. I saw her overcoming her fears and school struggles. She never gave up and we even took classes together!
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? My sketch book with a pencil for drawing and writing. The book 100 Years of Solitude because it's one of my favorites. My kickboxing gloves to practice.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Probably Sandra. Her first two seasons with the ""as long as it's not me"" and playing low key until the end was good. I would also have eaten that goat if possible on Game Changers. It's food!
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I want to prove to myself and my friends that I can do this. I've been a fan of the show since the first season, although sometimes I forget some details. My friends think that just because I don't go camping, I can't do it. This is also a social game, not just physical, and I think I can outwit and outlast just being me and using my brains. I also have student loans and a Ph.D to pay. I would also like to win the game for parents and friends. After Hurricane Maria, things got very hectic back home in Puerto Rico, and I would love to be able to help them.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I might not be a physical threat, although I have been doing kickboxing for about four months, but I think studying other contestants, using their weaknesses to my advantage and keeping a good social game, I would win. I am mostly relying on my social game. I will vote off people but my relationships with them would be real. I am a very loyal, honest person, so I would try not to backstab people, but it's a game and I want to win.[3]

Hometown: Dallas, Ft. Worth, Texas
Current residence: Longview, Texas
Occupation: Kitchen Staff
Hobbies: Gardening and growing my own food, horseback riding (haven't had horses for a few years though), and cooking down to earth but fantastic food.
Pet peeves: Oh, I hate lazy people. And people that don't have a lick of common sense—I would call them stupid. Momma always said to use your noodle—God gave it to you for a reason. Boring and dull pisses me off too. Oh and whiners—I can't stand whining!
Three words to describe you: Hardworking, unique, and crazy.
What's your personal claim to fame? Being a mom. I pushed two girls out with no pain meds. I was a beast! Also, winning three state championships in Kentucky 4-H with my poor horses. Developing and managing the most successful program at Redcloud, ""JAW,"" which was an intense discipleship program for high schoolers, to teach work ethic, service, Bible, and riding instructing skills.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My brother Josh. He is in the U.S. military. Everything he does is out of love and pride for our country and the people in it. He loves and adores his family and is fiercely loyal to his faith and God. We were best friends growing up and we talked about everything. As we each have our own families now, we don't talk as much, but I love him more than ever. And I literally think of him anytime I am going through a struggle and I remember to keep pushing and don't quit!
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? My hat. I feel naked without my hat. Like I would wear my genuine wool lined raccoon hat to church when I was 11. My mom would sometimes try to get me to take it off, but it ended in a blow up fight. I wore my hat during labor and delivery for my two daughters, and also during my surgical C section with my son. I sure had to convince the surgeon to allow my hat in that operating room. And chocolate. Every girl who has ever had a period needs chocolate. It's also good for sad, or happy, or mad, or hungry. Finally, a notebook and a pencil. So I could keep track of my thoughts and plans better. Especially without someone to bounce ideas off of—I would not want to forget something obvious.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Big Tom from Africa. He was a redneck, funny, knows more about farming than current culture. Also, Sandra Diaz-Twine, who was passionate, smart, played the game hard, and objective.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Being true to who I am and pursuing my dreams. No matter how crazy. It's not crazy if it's something you want to do. I can't stand the idea of living with regrets. I want to LIVE my life. The craziest/stupidest thing someone could do would be to love cautiously and in fear. Pursue your dream, who knows it may come true. I can win! Like I believe I will win, if I get to hear Jeff say the words, ""Welcome to Survivor, here are your buffs."" I watched my first episode during Australia and loved it. Even as a kid, I knew I was made for this show. And that I could win and make all of us southerners proud!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will be liked and needed by all especially at the beginning, the provider role. I will develop relationships with unlikely people and help bring cultures and ages together. I will be competitive in challenges. I am strong and don't quit. I didn't quit through my season of depression. Just kept putting one foot in front of the other. Didn't rely on feelings, but logic. I defend people and injustices. People talk to me because I am trustworthy. I have watched enough of the game to know how it is played, but not so fanatic about it that I am a geek. I just LOVE the show. I love strategy and don't mind cutting ties if it benefits me, even if it is hard. I have moved all over the planet and it all worked out.[2]

Hobbies: Parkour/MMA, writing, and surfing.
Pet peeves: Unsolicited advice. Delusional people.
Three words to describe you: Irreverent, ambitious, and optimistic.
What's your personal claim to fame? Pro wrestling fans around the world know John Hennigan as The Mayor Of Slamtown, Johnny Nitro, John Morrison, Johnny Mundo, Johnny Impact, the Shaman of Sexy, The Wednesday Night Delight... I've had more epic ring names than most wrestlers have had championships and in addition to those, plenty of other nicknames that aren't so nice. In addition to being a world famous pro wrestler, I starred in dozens of TV shows, such as GLOW on Netflix, and movies including the award-winning action comedy Boone: The Bounty Hunter, which I also wrote and produced.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My dad is the most authentic, charismatic, well-read human that I know. He has worked tirelessly to provide an amazing life for my sisters, my mother and I, he's the center of every conversation in which he engages, and always has time for family.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? Three ab wheels... in case the first two break. It's important to not underestimate fitness on the island.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Mike Holloway with shades of Cochran—I plan to form alliances early and play a loyal game at first. Play strategically in challenges; dominate when necessary. If it seems strategically wise I'll dominate challenges, but I plan to have more tact than Mike when it comes to publicly putting my desire to win the game over the group's happiness because that kills trust within the group. The way Cochran was there for people as a ""therapist"" is similar to how Mike stood up to for Shirin, but Cochran seemed to have a more constant relationship with his group than Mike.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I want to win and I want the money. I'm planning on buying a Corvette the size of a Hummer, but as fast as a Corvette. With some of my winnings.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? My daily life consists of physical training, building relationships, and positioning myself favorably in dozens of wrestling organizations worldwide. I currently consistently work for over 20 different wrestling promotions all over the world. Two years ago, I came to Triple A without speaking fluent Spanish and sat in a locker room full of prideful luchadores, some of whom had worked for that company for over 20 years. Less than one year later, I'm the first non-Mexican Triple Champion of Triple A because I positioned myself strategically within that organization, built a great relationship with the owner, and by kicking ass, like I kick ass in the ring my talent could not be overlooked. I am an English speaking Irish-American who grew up in Palos Verdes, and a multi-million dollar Mexican wrestling company decided that I am the best person to represent their brand. Everywhere I go the challenge is the same. I win because I understand how to play the game.[1]

Age: 27

Current Residence: Gainesville, Florida
Occupation: S.W.A.T. Officer
Hobbies: Working out in the gym, running at the stadium, or running the S.W.A.T. obstacle course, playing video games, and having date nights with my daughters.
Pet peeves: I can't stand people that are lazy. Go out and get what you want! Don't complain about it and do nothing and expect it to happen. I also hate when people cut me off while I'm talking. Please let me finish what I have to say, it may be important.
Three words to describe you: Determined, athletic, and competitive.
What's your personal claim to fame? I am extremely proud of making our S.W.A.T. team. I had to work extremely hard to lose a ton of weight to be physically able to even try out, much less do well enough to make the team. I was one of the youngest and least experienced people to ever make our S.W.A.T. team.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My hero is my stepfather, Tim. Tim met my mother shortly after my parents separated. My whole life he has always been a steady father figure and an amazing role model. He taught me the value of hard work and how to be a humble man. When I met Tim at seven years old, he had nothing. My mother and him worked diligently and started a company from nothing and now want for nothing. Don't get me wrong, they aren't billionaires, but they pretty much do what they want when they want. Tim works many long hours and long nights to provide an amazing life to our family. The best part about him is you will never hear him brag about it. There is a song written by Brad Paisley that makes me think of him and brings tears to my eyes when I hear it. It's called ""He Didn't Have to Be."" It talks about how his stepfather was a great father to him and he hoped that he can be half the dad that he didn't have to be. That describes how I feel about Tim.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? A picture of my kids because I will miss them terribly. A Kindle with lots of books for entertainment. A hammock so I can have somewhere comfortable to sleep.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I feel like I can relate to Malcolm from Season 25 the most. I feel like I'm young and athletic like he is and that I could do well in the challenges, making me an asset to my team in the beginning. I also feel like I can play the game strategically like he did, helping me run deep in the game. I work in a profession that requires me to be able to talk to any type of person through all walks of life and be able to relate and convince them to do things that I may need them to do. Malcolm was such a likeable person that he was voted off because three other contestants knew they wouldn't beat him in the final vote. I feel like I'm a very likeable person. I am able to make friends and relate to people anywhere I go.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My primary motivation for being on the show is to win. A million dollars would be a great way for me to provide a great life for my children that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise. My secondary motivation is my desire to compete. I love competing and I love winning. I haven't been able to compete at a high level since I played college football and I would love to be able to compete against other gifted men and women.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I believe that I could be the winner for multiple reasons. I have a strong desire to win. I always want to win at absolutely everything I do. Whether it be checkers with my girls or just trying to be the first one to a call for service at work. I always want to be first. I have a strong work ethic. When I put my mind on something and decide that's what I want, I go and get it. Prime examples would be making our S.W.A.T. team. Prior to trying out, I was a very overweight guy. I decided that I wanted to be more than just a regularly everyday beat cop and I did whatever it took to do it. I changed my diet drastically, I worked out every single day, and I went to the track and ran sprints 2-3 times a week. Lastly, I'm very good with people. My career requires me to be able to talk to people all day. Everything I do at work requires interaction with people, and more importantly people who are typically either angry or distressed. I am very good at talking to people and convincing them to do things that they typically wouldn't want to do. I am quite skilled at calming people down when they are upset or angry.[2]

My dad has been laid off a time or two, but he's always thinking of creative ways to make money and fighting to make things work. My mom is a selfless individual, a hard worker in real estate, and someone who's always positive and wants nothing but the best for those around her. They both demonstrate a tremendous amount of courage and I love them.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? A picture of my loved ones to keep me motivated, a picture of my bank account statement because it's zero. And a guitar to sing ""Kumbaya"" by the fire.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I relate most to Jay, Joe, and Malcolm. All of those players are charming and likeable individuals. They were also all a dominating force during the challenges and physically fit which made them a useful asset around camp.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I've always been a go-getter and someone who doesn't take no for an answer. I want to outwit, outplay, and outlast everyone. I want to prove to myself that I can be that likable, charming and a physical threat player. I also want to be sitting at the Final Tribal Council and win the million-dollar prize!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have the ability to charm people around me, both guys and girls. I can read people and understand situations better than most.

Pet peeves: Loud chewers, people who are wrong about facts but think they are right, people who lack self-awareness.
Three words to describe you: Excitable, intelligent, and empathetic.
What's your personal claim to fame? Going from a couch potato to an adventure-seeker who sometimes gets off the couch to hike mountains, including 14ers (mountains over 14,000 feet)!
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Anyone brave enough to: be vulnerable, love with their whole heart, or speak out against injustice. And anyone brave enough to rock bangs.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? A phone to call my family and friends for love and advice. A journal so I could record my thoughts and plot out strategy. A mirror because I'd be scared something would be in my teeth the entire time and no one would tell me.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I relate to Aubry because she is both smart and emotionally intelligent. I am prone to tear-filled moments like Dawn. And I'm flirty like Parvati... if she were bad at flirting and only nerdy guys liked her.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Human psychology and social dynamics fascinate me, and I'm excited to insert myself into the craziest experiment out there. I simultaneously love and hate pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I want to see if I can rise above the mental, emotional, and physical turmoil found in this game.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have the knowledge of the game, but I'm social enough to hide it and not be a (complete) dork. I'm an emotional, empathetic person who happens to have the capacity for analytical thinking. My balance between brain and heart will win me allies and a million dollars.[2]

Age: 32
Hometown: Baltimore
Current residence: Tallahassee, Florida
Occupation: Robotics Scientist
Hobbies: Clarinet, primarily classical. I do gigs and perform in orchestras. Casual coding. I once wrote a computer program to crate train my dog. Success was mixed. Sous chef to my girlfriend—I chop, she cooks. Together, we make some good food. Probably because she handles the more important job.
Pet peeves: Condescension, clichés, and reckless abuse of percentages.
Three words to describe you: Intellectual, jovial, and driven.
What's your personal claim to fame? Getting my robotics research made fun of on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Stephen called me a ""nerd"" on national television. Bucket list stuff.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My parents are my heroes. No contest. They toasted my successes, comforted me in failure, and helped me back on my feet. I can't count all the ways they've supported me.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? Binoculars to try ""birding."" I've never done it, despite writing part of my dissertation on birds. Sounds relaxing. A graphing calculator; a good shelter is grounded in good trigonometry. Also, it should be grounded in dirt. And a thesaurus to give pity names to my strategic game moves.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Stephen Fishbach. He talked about the game as a chaotic whirlpool of alliances, and his nerdy game analysis warms my heart. I don't do poetry, but I wouldn't object to being called a wizard.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? To win and prove I'm not just a diploma or a résumé, that I'm a formidable person, qualifications or no. I also want to make my mark on this game and help innovate the way Survivor is strategically played. I need the game, and the game needs me.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I'll win with my intelligence, kindness, and creativity. I'll be quick to assess threats and avenues of advancement while cultivating positive relationships with everyone. If I'm in a tight spot, I'll adapt and figure a way out. What could go wrong?[2]

Age: 30
Hometown: Orangeburg, South Carolina
Current residence: Atlanta
Occupation: Social Media Manager
Hobbies: Swimming, hiking, biking, fishing—basically any outdoor activity that involves my huskies. Playing Scrabble, cosplaying, and memes!
Pet peeves: I don't like people making decisions for me, especially without asking my opinion. Never expect a free ride with me if I see you being complacent. I will push you to get up and show initiative. There's nothing that bothers me more than a lazy person who acts privileged around those who've had to work for things their entire life. Oh, and calling me Dave or David instead of Davie, my momma named me that!
Three words to describe you: Uncommon, adventurous, and calculating.
What's your personal claim to fame? My online presence. I've always prided myself on my social media presence via various platforms. I wear my pages on my sleeve so to say that anything a person wants to know about me they can find on my multiple accounts. I've been proclaimed ""the social media guru"" among my closest friends because I know every trick and trinket to the game. Examples: Posting at peak hours to maximize the amount of ""likes"" you receive, guaranteed responses from females via Direct Messages (how to slide into them DMs), not to mention providing Grade A entertainment via video stories regularly. I've often also been told that my Instagram/Twitter/Facebook is ""my favorite"" from friends and even been called by my Instagram handle in public quite frequently (@iHateDavie) by strangers. Social media is also the reason I became employed with the top agency in the world for Public Health. I can say with confidence that it is my expertise and claim to fame undeniably.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Rick Grimes is my hero, though he is a fictional character. I have learned so much from him, from leadership skills to dealing with new people and new surroundings. The lead character in The Walking Dead, Rick leads a group of average individuals who become stronger because of his teachings and experiences. He defeats all of his enemies in a strategic and calculating way. Rick is dedicated to the title that his group has given him and is a provider for his family and friends, like myself. He has good days and bad days but never gives up. I channel Rick in a crisis and it helps me stable my mind, while having a little fun in the process.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?
My harmonica. I believe in therapy and relaxation and making my own music will do just that. When I am stressed in the game, I can create this escape mentally and physically and maybe even look for idols in the process or entertain a few people and make friends along the way.
My Davy Crockett hat. It's my lucky hat. I have worn it to tests and passed and I have worn it on dates and gotten lucky. When I wear this hat, I channel my best self.
My Bible. I believe that Christ strengthens my being and it's important that I review his teachings, especially in times of chaos and struggle.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Jeremy Collins. He was genuinely a good guy that knew when to speak and knew when to observe, that's my Obama! Also, Tony Vlachos, in that he was an innovative thinker to the game. Finally, Adam Klein in that he's a family man with a giddy sense of humor. They are all winners and so am I!
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I want to prove to myself that I can do this. I was always teased for not playing popular sports like my friends so this would be my ultimate competition. I'm the middle child so almost the black sheep of the family. Both of my brothers are so accomplished so I want to have my own unique medal of self-accomplishment. My secondary motivation is my pack, my huskies. Recently, my beta wolf Luna Moon was hit by a car. I thought she was dead but we were able to save her. However, not without me being in debt. With my winnings, I want to create an insurance company for pet owners so that when things like this happen to us, we won't be faced with the hardest decision of our lives (putting a pet down).
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I understand how packs work. As a Siberian husky breeder, I know that in order to gain the trust of my pups, I have to feed them. I'm a skilled fisherman so as soon as I can get in the water to catch fish for my tribe, I will earn their trust. I also build doghouses and construct kennels for my pups and with my tribe, this would be no different. Creating new innovative, comforting types of shelter will show me as an asset. Lastly, with my pack, I have to be stern with them. I will mingle with the entire tribe, not just a few to show my sociability while also being assertive with them when it's time to put my foot down.[2]

Occupation: Physician
Hobbies: Getting to the bottom of bottomless breadsticks at Olive Garden. Working out in any capacity—typically swimming, circuit training, running or hiking. Playing medical ""would you rather"" with friends.
Pet peeves: A sense of entitlement, when someone eats the last bite of a meal after I have been carefully constructing the perfect final bite, and slow drivers in the left hand lane.
Three words to describe you: Hero, healer, and hustler.
What's your personal claim to fame? Got fifth place in my grade school spelling bee.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My parents taught me about work ethic, industry, and perseverance. They made so many sacrifices so that my siblings and I would have every opportunity possible. They pushed me to be the best version of myself. They also demonstrated daily how to lead a purposeful life guided by integrity and morality.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? To quote Dwight K. Schrute, ""Physician's desk reference. Hollowed out. Inside, waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars and a NASA blanket."" The reason seems obvious here. Also, face wash. I appreciate a good skincare regimen. And a Costco pack of Orbitz bubblemint gum for that minty fresh taste.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Andrea Boehlke, a fellow Midwesterner, who is tough in challenges, hardworking around camp, strategic, and a fierce competitor.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I want to win a million dollars so that I may thank my parents for the endless opportunities that they have given me through the years. I also feel like I have lived an extraordinary life, but I am looking for new, unparalleled adventure. I have been on this well-defined path for ten years, pursuing medicine, and now is the perfect opportunity for me to deviate from the expected and do something totally unpredictable.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? The stakes are higher for me than most as I am acutely aware of what I am giving up (in stepping away from my patients and my program for two months), so I will not be afraid to make big moves. I will fight until the very end, and then when sitting across from the jury at the Final Tribal Council, they will all commend the brilliant, strategic game I played.[2]

Hobbies: Friends (not the show, real people). Running/biking/yoga. Dancing/snowboarding.
Pet peeves: Drivers who use their brakes unnecessarily, oblivious people, and when anyone tells someone else how to live their life.
Three words to describe you: Energetic, persistent, and passionate.
What's your personal claim to fame? Making Charger Girls. I was Rookie of the Year, MVP in 2014 and a captain for two years.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My mom always dropped wisdom. She was the epitome of what a mother should be to her kids. She was the perfect role model and practiced what she preached. Not to mention, she was hilarious and opinionated. Other people said she was just the classiest lady who everyone lived. I think she lived life so fully that God decided she was ready for heaven. She'll always be my hero.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? The book The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer—it talks a lot about clearing your mind and that could be crucial. A mirror. Sounds vein, but could help make a fire plus it would be interesting to see who insists on looking in it. A deck of cards; can be used for entertainment as well as another form of character judgement.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Parvati Shallow because she's brilliant, she's flirtatious, and she won! Her alliances were well thought out and she made power plays at the right time. I would have a positive attitude and make connections like Figgy except I'd avoid getting into a showmance at all cost.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? To win one million dollars! It would be nice to help my dad get back on his feet for good; he ran a successful business until he lost it all in the recession. I helped support, but I could only do so much. I also want to step outside my comfort zone to prove I can do anything with the right mindset. This would really help carry out my mom's legacy and make her really proud. I would also love to have a down payment for a house. I live in San Diego, one of the hottest real estate markets... and it's expensive!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am relentless. I don't give up. I know how to get along and even make friends with all walks of life. I'm kind of a chameleon. I guess I'd consider myself pretty savvy and adept. I observe everything, yet have the ability to keep to myself if need be. I'm strong and focused, therefore could be a threat in challenges. Plus, I am not afraid to be cutthroat if I have to. In today's world, I think you'd call that savage. My social game would be impressive, plus I could win over the jury with game tactics and strategy.[2]

Hobbies: Traveling the world, trying new things, political activism, hosting margarita nights, dancing, workout classes, anything involving French bulldogs, and starting my non-profit Ready to Run, which encourages, empowers, and equips middle school and high school aged girls to run for student government positions in their schools.
Pet peeves: Indecisiveness, when people don't vote, and when people don't like dogs.
Three words to describe you: Intuitive, persuasive, and loving.
What's your personal claim to fame? I was elected to serve over 15,000+ students at Stanford University as Student Body President, and I was the first Latina to hold the position.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My parents. They have both worked incredibly hard for everything they have and to make a good life for us kids. Because of them, and their never-ending love and support and belief in me, I have been able to accomplish everything I've ever set my mind to.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? A copy of Maya Angelou's ""Still I Rise,"" a poem that sums up my mindset for life and Survivor. A radio so I could listen to the news every day. Not knowing what's going on in the world around me is going to be one of the hardest parts of the game for me. And make-up. I'm not going to front, I wear it every day.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Natalie Anderson for her intellect, sense of timing and character. Parvati for her charm, social awareness and cunningness. And both women for their warrior spirits and overall badassness.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Survivor is the ultimate challenge of grit, savviness, and strategy. As a naturally competitive person, I want to test myself, my abilities and my limits. As a military spouse, I believe we are most of the strongest and most adaptable people. I want to win because my husband will head out on his second deployment this year, and I want to be a source of strength and inspiration for other military families who have endured long months and years away from their soldier. Also, winning a million dollars is obviously a huge motivation—like many Americans I have a lot of student debt from school, and being able to pay that off would be a game changer.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have always been an extremely optimistic and positive person, I always see the best in everything/everyone and make the most out of even the hardest situations. Even though I'm not super outdoorsy, I'm a quick learner and always down to try something new. I'm also scrappy, adaptable, smart, fun, and determined as hell. Most importantly though, my love for people, empathy, and emotional awareness are what I credit for much of what I've accomplished in my 28 years of life. I'm able to get along with anyone, and people tend to trust me. Lastly, I'm not afraid to take risks and play hard. I will use all of these skills, at the right time with the right people, in order to make it all the way to the end.[3]

Who or what is your inspiration in life? I think of George Plimpton, a great writer who also wanted to experience the things he was writing about. He was fearless, inquisitive and enlightened.
If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why? An eye mask to sleep. A good book; something fat. A SeaBob for the ocean!
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Jonathan Penner was a good storyteller and Rob from Amazon had a good read on people.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My primary motivation is playing the game. I've always, always wanted to play and see how I would do. Secondary is the absurd challenge of it all.

Pet peeves: People getting offended over every little thing and know-it-alls.
Three words to describe you: Charming, outgoing, and intelligent.
What's your personal claim to fame? Becoming a Redneck Lawyer! I am a first generation college student and the first in my family to get a bachelor degree. I am also proud of myself for being a public defender to help people instead of chasing money—especially because money and the thought of being rich motivated me in school.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Mamaw Joan—my grandma. She is the most selfless person I've ever met. When my mom and dad got divorced she raised me and my four siblings while we stayed with my dad. She taught me life-changing lessons like the value of hard work and the importance of helping others. She also taught me how to enjoy a beer and some bluegrass music. Work hard, play hard, love hard. Her favorite quote was, ""If you don't use it, you lose it!""
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A cooler, beer, and a radio. Nothing beats being outdoors and putting a few back. As great as it is at a tailgate, on the lake, or at a bonfire, I bet it would be even more enjoyable on the beaches of Fiji.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? J.T. from Tocantins, Heroes vs. Villains, and Game Changers. I've got that Southern charm. I can be hard headed when in the heat of a competition. I'll either win or get myself sent home with a massive swing for the fences. No regrets!
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I think there are three reasons people play Survivor: adventure, money, and fame. My primary motivation is the experience and adventure! It has been my dream to play this game since I was a little kid. I want to push myself even further in life then I already have and test myself. My secondary motivation is the money. If I had a million dollars, I could pay off my student loans, which would open up my career options a little more. Money is not my primary motivation, because I anticipate I will make a million dollars in my career at some point. I do not care about fame. These days, Survivor contestants are only famous for about six months, anyways.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I know I could be the final Survivor because I am the total package for this game, First, I am an adamant, hard-working son of a gun. I have chased my dreams my whole life and achieved those, despite humble beginnings. Second, I am a likeable, social guy. Third, I am physically fit and stronger than I look. I will do great in the challenges—tribal and individual, physical and puzzle. Fourth, I am very smart and it is hidden well behind my accent and appreciation for small town life. I will definitely be underestimated. Finally, I am a Survivor strategy expert. I am a super fan who has analyzed every season and every move. As I said, I am the Survivor total package.[1]

Hobbies: Writing and performing my poetry, tennis, playing video/board games, and going to the movies.
Pet peeves: When self-absorbed people talk about all the money they have and things they've done, and only actively engage in conversations when the topic is about them or their ""equals.""
Three words to describe you: Religious, competitive, and creative.
What is your personal claim to fame? Getting the Jackie Robinson scholarship because I had never before achieved something on a national level. It still amazes me! They had over 3,500 applicants, gave interviews to 140 and awarded only 63. To be a part of that 63 still leaves me in awe and I know it's only by God's grace.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My inspirations are definitely my mom and grandma! Without them there's no way I would be the type of person I am today. They taught me morals, values, and how to always have a loving and caring personality. They've seen me at my lowest times and have never withheld their love for me. We never had much but my mom always made ends meet for me. My grandma was the one who first started me on my walk in faith, which is my biggest rock in life. They are my heroes!
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
My Bible because it would be a constant reminder for me that God is always watching over me!
My poetry book because my poetry gives me life!
My Black Panther jacket because I'm a Marvel fanatic and it can always bring a smile to my face.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? I relate to Jeremy Collins because that was a family man. He put his family above all else and played solely for them. My family is the only tangible thing I've always had since day one! They're my reason for everything. I also think I'd love to rely more on social gameplay as he did and connect with people for longevity.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? No doubt my primary motivation for being on the show is my family. Since I was born, we've lived in the same trailer without much change. Ever since I was doing well in school, I feel like eyes have been on me to help us out of stagnation. If I can make some things happen to help us go above and beyond, then you can best believe I'm going to be that breakthrough. Survivor may just be that start for me. Secondly, I'm motivated to learn more about myself. I've never had to find my food or stay outside, so I'm ready to see what I can do when tested. And of course, I'm a superfan and this has been a dream of mine! I'm already the youngest black castaway to date. How cool would it be to add being the youngest Sole Survivor onto that?
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I know I can be the Sole Survivor because I've already been living against the odds. Me being a lower-class black man, I wasn't nurtured to be the salutatorian of his class that would be able to afford Duke University of all places. I didn't have the bloodline of doctors to show me how to succeed or the finances to take prep classes for educational opportunities. I didn't even know what class rank or GPA meant until junior year. When I took the Pre-SAT, I asked ""What class is this for?"" I was set at a disadvantage, yet I made things happen. I went against the grain, and did what I needed to do to put myself on a pre-med track. I'm driven, focused, and possess the willpower to make mountains move. Nothing has stopped me thus far, so no 17 or 19, or however many castaways are going to stop me now![3]

Age: 30
Hometown: Cambridge, MA
Previously played on: Season 32: Brains vs. Brawn vs. Beauty, Runner Up
How have you changed since the last time you played? I'm more assertive, confident, and grounded in who I am. In my last season, I logically knew I could play and do well. This time, I believe it. I have an easier time taking stock of the cards on the table, making decisions, and rolling with the consequences.
What skills do you bring to Survivor that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? I bring the confidence in my physical abilities. In Kaôh Rōng, I proved I was a brain who could hang with brawn. I might not look athletic, but I am. I've been working on core strength and balance. Emotionally, I'm more grounded than I was. I can be an attractive ally or confidant to other tribe mates, especially those on the outskirts, without letting those relationships drain me.
What are you most proud of from the last time? I am beyond proud that I made it to Day 39 despite encountering some obstacles, including:
- Having a horrendous Day 2.
- Crappily executing the Pete vote. This time, I'll be folding the paper up, eating it for fiber, and taking a new parchment if I change my mind.
- My infection.
- Two closest allies being medically evacuated.
- Being forced to make fire to save myself.
I managed some tough personalities and assembled a ragtag group to vote out Scot, which felt like dismantling a bomb, making sure all the wires were where they needed to be. Overall, I may have bumped into more obstacles than a ball in a pinball machine, but I played proactively. I owned my actions and fate, and I did it in a way that was true to me.
What, if anything, do you most regret? I wish I could take back every second of every one of the five days I lived with Nick. Oh, and I regret letting Joe eat all the red meat.
How would you play differently this time? Going into Game Changers, I know I'll have a target on my back, especially since other players will have just seen my season. I can't play under the radar… people won't buy it. I plan to align with a variety of people, including power players and villains to pad myself. In Survivor 34, I will:
1. Do with certainty and apologize later.
2. Be friendly with more people and have intense relationships with less.

3. Execute with finesse.[2]

Hobbies: Swimming, rock climbing, anything active, karaoke, and getting into shenanigans!
Pet peeves: I cannot stand when people don't carry their weight. I also hate quitters! Find a way to get something done! Don't just give up when the going gets tough.
Three words to describe you: Idiosyncratic, fun-loving, and spontaneous.
What is your personal claim to fame? Starting my own business from the ground up.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My mom is my greatest inspiration. She worked hard and raised three daughters all by herself. I don't know what I would do without her!
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
I would definitely need to take a small jar of Vaseline, my lips get dry!
Hair ties: I cannot stand when my hair is in my face! I need it up to win challenges.
Last but not least, I really want to take Scruffy. Okay context time: I have a stuffed animal that I have had for 20 years and I have never slept without him even to this day. My sister and BF insist I don't take him because what if I get him sandy or ruin him. I'm conflicted.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? I am a hybrid of many players! I think I would play the game like Sandra, I would be the second Diaz to win! But my attitude towards people would be more like Tai. He is just so full of life and I love his outlooks on things.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I would like to be on the show because I want to see how tough it really is. I love putting myself in these kinds of situations and when watching the show, I have a sense that I can do this with ease. My second motivation would probably be the money. Not in the typical sense. I have always said that I want to be rich just so I am able to help other people. I grew up poor, and I am by no means well off now, but I am content with my life and need nothing more. I could use that money to help people, even in the smallest way. Especially my mom and people like her.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I think I have the agility and the cunningness to win. I love outdoorsy stuff and can't wait to see what the wilderness throws at me![1]

Age: 34
Hometown: Chicago
Current residence: Livermore, California
Occupation: Firefighter
Hobbies: Backpacking, basketball, woodworking, and pretty much anything outside.
Pet peeves: My biggest pet peeve is people taking themselves too seriously. Come on, relax people. I try to remember that 99.9 percent of the time I am NOT the smartest, coolest, most interesting, deserving, or important person in the room.
Three words to describe you: Enthusiastic, outgoing, and spontaneous.
What is your personal claim to fame? I am extremely proud of my profession. It was a lot of hard work and took some serious grit to get where I am. I'm proud of that, and what I am now a part of. Good people! I'm also very proud of being a good dad! I had one of the best fathers on the planet, so I have big shoes to fill. So far, it's going pretty good.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? The first person that comes to mind is my older son Levi. Levi is an amazing kid. A couple months before he turned two, he was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Simply put, he has some challenges that most kids don't and yet he is the most joy-filled, free-spirited, hard working kid I know. He really is a special human and I get to be his dad. How rad is that! He is all the motivation I need!
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
A picture of my family to remind me why I am playing and why I need to play so hard.
A book. Something to feed my mind and something to keep me grounded. Most likely my Bible.
A surfboard.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? I have to say Tony Vlachos. I don't think we are very similar people but I think we agree fundamentally on how you play the game. Tony was a grinder from start to finish. He understands that EVERY piece of the game, EVERY moment, EVERY situation has value and can be used to influence your outcome. I think most players only identify the most obvious parts of Survivor as pieces on the board when in reality, every last detail is a movable piece. It's going to be my goal to be ""ON"" all the time in the game. In other words, to never stop playing. I plan to work angles everywhere and with everyone... all the time. I think this is how you win, by paying attention to the details and then playing off of them. Tony did that I think, and so will I.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My primary goal of being on the show is for the adventure of it! Adventure is something that is important to me, and something I think I will always pursue. But this adventure is a unique opportunity to practice the things I preach to my sons. The show will give me an opportunity to show them that hard work pays off and that pipe dreams are absolutely worth chasing! This show is a special platform to tell a really good story!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I think I have a lot of skills that serve a team well. I have a strong work ethic, I'm good with my hands, I'm strong and physical, and I think I'm good at making people feel valued. Another thing I am good at is keeping/bringing people together. I think I have the gift of mediation, which will be HUGE in Survivor! Someone has to keep the alliance glue sticky... I just might be that guy.[2]

Pet peeves: Being ignored, loud chewing, and when people document EVERYTHING on social media.
Three words to describe you: Adventurous, resilient, and personable.
What is your personal claim to fame? I definitely feel proud to be the first in the family to graduate college and pave the way for my younger sister and family members.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My mom. She has faced some of life's hardest challenges but she has remained beautiful inside and out and kept her optimism intact. I can only hope to be as strong as she is.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
Pen and paper to document my thoughts, stories, and strategy.
A radio or something to play music because music keeps me going.
Picture of my family. Everything I do is for them. This would help me get through rough times in the game.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? Jeremy! He was a physical beast, but he was strategic in his use of Idols, loyal to his alliance, and overall honest and personable in his gameplay. He was a well-rounded player.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? It has been my dream to be on Survivor since I started watching as a kid. It started after the passing of my father, and in a sense, it helped me ""survive"" my own challenges. I want to prove to myself I can do this. To win a million dollars is also a huge motivation. I have many student loans and I want to be able to help my sister and mother.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am a team player and an excellent communicator. I have charm and wits and I am not afraid to make risky moves.[2]

Name: David Wright
Age: 42
Current residence: Sherman Oaks, CA
Occupation: Television writer
Tribe designation: Takali (Gen-X)
Three words to describe you: OCD, nervous, and paranoid.
Hobbies: 3D printing puzzles.
Pet peeves: Sudden, loud noises; people who don't use a turn signal; people who believe in ghosts and psychics; people who are late for dinner; people who incorrectly use the word ""nonplussed;"" people.
What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? Gen-Xers believe in hard work, earning their rewards, and eating breakfast. Why does no one eat breakfast anymore?!
Personal claim to fame: Playing chess against Magnus Carlsen, the No. 1 ranked player in the world.
Inspiration in life: Mr. Spock [from Star Trek]. He's highly intelligent, logical, and has trouble fitting in.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Beads, string, and polished stones to make fake Immunity Idols for other people to find.
Survivor contestant you're most like: I relate most to the guys who don't fit in such as John Cochran (South Pacific, Caramoan)—he's my intellectual equal with slightly larger muscles. I also relate to Joe Anglim's (Worlds Apart, Cambodia) puzzle-solving skills, but, unfortunately, not his full head of hair, or way with the ladies.
Reason for being on Survivor: I want to use Survivor as a tool to battle my insecurities and overcome my fears and anxiety.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? My weaknesses and flaws are my strengths. Because of my small size and lack of physical stature, people won't perceive me as a threat. I also have the most important Survivor trait one can have: paranoia. My eyes and ears will be at full attention, searching for any hint of a vote going bad for me. Chess has taught me to always look ahead, so I'm prepared to seize an opportunity when one presents itself. I won't let emotions and feelings stand in the way of reaching Final 3.[2]

Hobbies: Gym, basketball, and Netflix binging.
Pet peeves: Weakness for sure, but most of all negative energy, that person who just complains constantly that the world never breaks their way.
Three words to describe you: Confident, self-amused, and passionate.
What is your personal claim to fame? Bronze Star Medal in Afghanistan, close second was being the youngest in my Basic Training company and making it through in a time when 20 percent or so were sent home. It was 1997 pre-war standards.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? The young men and women who joined the Army after the war began, I fought alongside these 19, 20, and 21-year-olds, and they certainly were my heroes.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
Nail clippers: I don't know why, dirty long nails just strike a chord.
Football: it would be nice to have something to toss around.
Chess Board or deck of cards: sometimes it would be nice to remove your brain from the game but I don't know if that's even possible.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? The Wardog is his own blend—I'm not Tony, I'm not the Specialist, I'm not Boston Rob. Whose game did I respect the most? That's a better question. I thought Yul played great, I thought Mike was a great winner, I loved Parvati's game, Earl dominated, the third version of Tyson, the first version of Country Bumpkin (J.T).
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Win the game of games! Also, to go on an adventure that few will ever partake in, and to challenge myself physically, mentally, and emotionally.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I bring a certain sex appeal that men my age haven't had for over a decade or most have never had. But I digress; I also bring a sharp mind, likable joyful personality, one that can be both subservient when I need to be and a leader when there is a vacuum of leadership. I bring a strong set of physical skills, and I won't be the one whining and complaining. In the end, I'll make them laugh when we are all having a miserable moment.[3]

Age: 46
Hometown: Chocowinity, North Carolina
Current residence: Atlanta
Occupation: Teacher, Ron Clark Academy
Hobbies: Life doesn't get any better than giving my Chow Chow pups belly rubs! I also get a kick out of watching the roulette ball spin and land in the single zero, but I think my main hobby is surprising people by making really unique moments for them. When I was a kid my family didn't have money, but my parents put a lot of effort into making simple moments magical. I now try to follow in their footsteps and try my best to do that for my students, friends, and family. I also like telling stories and participating in anything competitive such as poker, pool, trivia, basketball, tennis and ""Bamboo Stick Speller,"" a game my friends and I created.
Pet peeves: I'm a sore loser. Like really sore. I'll stew over a Monopoly loss for weeks, wondering, ""just where did I go wrong."" Also, I hate when people slurp food (like soup) or smack chew gum. People, we can hear you!
Three words to describe you: Visionary, compassionate, ""mean girl.""
What is your personal claim to fame? I co-founded the Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta where we teach using passion, innovative strategies, and creative methods to inspire all of our students to reach success. Each week, we also train educators from around the world so that they can incorporate our strategies in their schools. To date, over 50,000 educators have visited RCA to receive training, and we are starting a revolution! I hope that doesn't overshadow the fact that back in 2002 I won the Showcase Showdown on The Price is Right.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My students inspire me to do more and be a better person! I love the way they forgive easily, laugh heartily and bounce back. They are great role models! Also: Antoni Gaudí gives me life! He is the most creative genius to ever walk the earth!!
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
A recording device that I could leave under the shelter so that I would always be in the know.
A returning player that others would focus on voting out so that the target wouldn't be on me.
My wedding ring so I'd be inspired by the love waiting for me at home.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? I'm a compassionate person, but everyone who knows me well says that during competitions I turn into a villain. I also over analyze everything. For those reasons, I don't think there's a past contestant that is a perfect fit for me, but I think my gameplay will be most like Spencer Bledsoe.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Since Survivor: Borneo I have been hooked. My friends and I have hung on every episode, pausing constantly to debate moves and re-watching our favorite episodes again and again. I tell my students all the time that life is for living and that they should seek to never have regrets. ""Dream Big!"" After watching Survivor for most of my adult life, I finally decided to take my own advice and apply. I want to live the experience and share my journey with the ones I love. It would be a monumental moment in my life!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? My passion for life rubs off on people, and with focus, I can change people's moods and get them to follow my lead. I'll use my southern charm to disarm, my big personality to entertain and my loyal nature to disorient.[2]

Pet peeves: Know-it-alls, ignorance, playing the victim card, any noise coming from the mouth, the easily offended, slow walkers, and people who are homophobic.
Three words to describe you: Direct, ruthless, and athletic.
What is your personal claim to fame? Having my mom tell me she was proud of who I became before she died. We were polar opposites and did not get along, but in the end, she was proud of me.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My brother Shane. We went into the foster care system after being taken away from our biological mother. Shane wouldn't leave my side and always protected me and made me feel normal. He made sure I wouldn't grow up with negative memories or scars and allowed me to become the person I am today.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
Gum: I have an addiction and I don't just chew, I chomp!
Sunglasses: I cannot hide my facial reactions and roll my eyes constantly.
Earplugs: I'm an extroverted introvert so the fact that I am surrounded by people and can't get away is going to drive me crazy.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? Tyson for being a manipulative, mischievous prankster, Ciera for her attitude and foot in the mouth moments, and Michaela for her die-hard competitiveness.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I love the show and have been obsessed with it since the beginning. I want to be in the depths of the conversations, manipulations, and absolute psychological warfare. Also, the competitions look like so much fun. Oh no, I have to stand in the middle of the blue ocean and prove I'm a badass—GAME ON!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I will bring my analytical skills. I'm good at going into a situation knowing what I want, reading others, and finding out what drives them, manipulating the situation to make them think my goal is theirs. I have the ability to take the personal side out and bring forth the cutthroat side.[2]

Pet peeves: Slow walkers, leaving cabinets open, my guinea pig who I named Peeve, and when customers don't read the menu and then ask dumb questions like, ""are there meatballs in the meatball sauce?""
Three words to describe you: Controlling, ambitious, and witty.
What is your personal claim to fame? I was valedictorian of my college with a perfect 4.0 and I bring it up in conversation as much as possible.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? This is going to sound nuts, but my guinea pig Scamp. She's been sick from the moment I got her. She's had two surgery stints, countless vet visits, and tons of medications, but she's still the happiest, feistiest, and most amazing little fur-ball. She has such a distinct personality and loves eating so much. I just respect that about her and strive to be that simplistically happy.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
A notebook and pencil (this is one item) to keep track of all my thoughts and to sketch.
Baby pillow: this tiny pillow I've had since I was born that I sleep with every night.
A guitar: No clue how to play one, but I figure I'll have lots of time to learn.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? I relate to Malcolm Freberg. If you read his Wiki Fandom page, he's described as ""likable, strategic, and excels at challenges"" and I'd like to think I am the same way.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My primary motivation is the once in a lifetime adventure! I've been watching since I was a little kid, and it's always been something I've wanted to do. Every contestant says it's life-changing. Secondary: the shot at a million dollars, of course!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I truly think I have everything it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast. I am and always have been a hustler. I work hard to achieve my goals. I'm sociable, very smart, strong, and self-aware enough to know when to tone down the quantities that make me a threat. I'm not afraid to lie and backstab, but I'm smart enough to know without alliances and bonds, you will never win.[2]

Hometown: Bakersfield, California
Current residence: Waco, Texas
Occupation: Student at Baylor University
Hobbies: Binge-watching multiple Netflix series at once, sleeping through my alarm, and eating a party-sized Peanut M&Ms bag in one sitting.
Pet peeves: People who are intolerant of someone else's personal opinions and beliefs, unnecessary rudeness, and those misguided people who choose Twizzlers over Red Vines.
Three words to describe you: Competitive, committed, and compassionate.
What is your personal claim to fame? I believe my claim to fame is my resilience and grit. Throughout my physically demanding career as a collegiate athlete on the Baylor Women's soccer team, I've endured four orthopedic surgeries, rehabilitated physically and emotionally in order to remain an integral part of an Elite 8 team, and will obtain a Bachelor's degree in Medical Humanities (in four years!) from a phenomenal university while prioritizing service and volunteerism in the community of Waco.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My parents inspire me. They love passionately: each other, their family, and their friends. They model compassion and selflessness through their daily actions and have taught me to persevere through grief and smile through life's toughest obstacles. They've inspired me to fight for things I believe in and they always remind me that my value is not determined by the perception of others. They love abundantly and without reservation, cheer for others in every circumstance, and model how to reflect Jesus in my life.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
My Bible to remind me that I can only find my worth in Him.
Sunscreen. But only SPF 25, because a little tan looks good on everyone.
M&Ms.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? Parvati Shallow is my spirit animal. Her infectious smile, smart wit, and expertise in using her sexuality has won her a place in my heart and I feel like my gameplay could be similar to hers. I also strongly relate to Kelley Wentworth's gameplay. She is unapologetically herself, dominates the physical demands of Survivor, and is a threat in any type of challenge. Ideally, I would play the game as a perfect mix of these two powerful females.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? My primary motivation for being on the show is to test my INDIVIDUAL capacity to rise to all the challenges I will face. I have played team sports from the time I was four years old and so have always had teammates to rely on when competition was intense. This game will push me to rely on MYSELF, with no parents or teammates who have my back, nobody to lift me up emotionally, and nobody to help me through the physical demands. It will be a true test of MY strengths, my confidence in my social skills, and my individual ability to build alliances that will benefit me, all in a very short and intense time period. The fierce competition from the starting moment is what draws me to this game. This has always been a dream and goal of mine! I told my family when I was seven years old that I would be on Survivor, and I FINALLY am! My final motivation is that I will be applying to dental school next year which is an extremely expensive dream, so when I am named Sole Survivor I'll be able to pay for this dream without incurring more debt. As a dentist, I plan to change lives by instilling confidence through beautiful smiles, and winning this game will help me to achieve this without the burden of debilitating debt.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have a competitive drive that few people can hope to match. I am a fierce athlete with the ability to endure extreme physical battles coupled with the desire to throw myself wholeheartedly into new adventures and challenging situations. ""Surviving"" won't be an issue—I plan to outlast and win. I am brilliantly strategic, but subtly humble about it, so people are not intimidated. In addition, I have a plan for a spectacular social game that cannot be beaten: allowing people to feel like they are in charge, while ensuring them that they are important, loved, and valued, all while I am masterminding moves in the background. I've studied this game for years, my Barbie and Ken doll were named Tina and Colby, and I know exactly how to manipulate if necessary in order to win.[2]

What is your personal claim to fame? My kids, BUT one time there was a cat stuck high (very high) up in a tree for days and may have died but I did a news story and contacted folks and got him rescued, so I have that going for me.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My father. He's totally focused and dedicated. A West Point grad and Airborne Army Ranger. He can do anything. Also, shout outs to Stephen Colbert and Stephen King who are brilliant and funny.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
The Stand by Stephen King. A great book and long so it'll entertain me for a while.
A LEGO figure. My son always asks me to keep his LEGO men safe.

Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? Cochran. He's a strategist. He was also a genuinely nice guy but he was there to PLAY!

Three words to describe you: Underestimated, determined, and maybe a little neurotic. Okay, I'm definitely neurotic.
What is your personal claim to fame? Raising my two kids who impress me every day with their intelligence, strength, humor, and resilience. I hope I can make them as proud of me as I am of them.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My husband. He is incredibly smart, caring, and selfless. He has always been there for me and supports me in everything I do.

If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?
My iPhone for its playlist of my favorite songs to keep me motivated when things get tough.
A picture of my husband, kids, and two Bernese mountain dogs to remember that they are back home rooting for me.
Milk chocolate. That's self-explanatory.
Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? A combo of Stephenie for her tenacity, Cirie for her humor and fun-spirit, and Dawn for her propensity to have some emotional moments.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? The challenge. I have wanted to play this insane game since I saw the very first episode. Something about pushing myself to the absolute physical and mental limit possible has always appealed to me. It's about proving to myself and to those that know me that I can actually do this!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? There is no doubt that I will be out of my comfort zone every step of the way, but when I set out to do something I become laser focused and I never give up. While I may not be the strongest physical player out there, I am smart, social, and will play the game with both my brain and my heart. I have waited 18 years to do this and nothing is going to stop me from winning. No other outcome is even an option![2]

What is your personal claim to fame? Five years ago I asked a girl to go out with me and she said no. One year later I asked again and she said yes. Now we are engaged and I couldn't be happier. She is also lucky because I am a catch! It's really an accomplishment for both of us.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My mom and dad. They have been my support system for the past 23 years and I wouldn't be the person I am today without them. They have taught me to always show kindness, no matter the situation. They have also taught me that if you truly want something in this life, you will do everything you can to get it, no matter what it takes.

Which Survivor contestant are you the most like? Keith Nale. Everyone loves Keith! I would just play more socially aware. He's the only guy that could compete with Joe Anglim. I want to be the guy everyone is pulling for back home.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I have this internal drive to win the show. I listen to the theme song when I shower and I dream of winning Immunity. It's just a burning desire I have always had. I love this show. Also, to prove to my mom I won't be voted out first. She about died when I showed her the application. She said I would embarrass myself or pass out when I got hungry. You just wait, Mom...
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? First off, if I can survive running a summer camp with 100 crazy kids, I know I can survive on an island with 20 crazy people.

What's your reason for being on Survivor? My primary motivation is to say that I accomplished the goal that I was set out to do—win! Even if the grand prize was $1,000, if I say I am going to do something, then I am everything in my control to achieve it.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I can make fire, fish, build shelter, and I will most likely be cooking a lot of meals (I'm big into cooking). Also, I'd work hard and won't lay around camp. I'm a team player in terms of getting a group to work together, I am extremely competitive, and I will do whatever it takes to help my team win![2]

Age: 35
Hometown: Brockton, Massachusetts

Hobbies: Kickboxing, beatboxing, and hiking.
Pet peeves: When people try to enter my elevator just as I am trying to exit! Also watching someone misplay a Hidden Immunity Idol makes me nuts.
Three words to describe you: Resilient, analytical, and savvy.
What accomplishment are you most proud of? Holding the world record for most consecutive cashes in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) main event. Also getting my dad out of Brockton and buying him a place in Henderson, Nevada!
Who or what is your inspiration in life? The American soldiers who risk their lives everyday fighting for our freedom. Also those who never give up.
What's one thing we wouldn't know from seeing a photo of you? That I am musically inclined.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Jeremy Collins because he's charismatic, loyal, compassionate, and can read players so well. Strategically, my approach would be a hybrid of Devon Pinto—bluffing the dumb role sneakily well—and Boston Rob—impeccable timing of making big moves and sniffing out when people are up to something.
What's your primary motivation for being on Survivor? To challenge myself like I never have before. I spend my life adapting to ever-changing environments. I grew up in a rough inner-city neighborhood and rose above and have been successful in one of the most competitive, cutthroat businesses on Earth. Poker is such a great challenge and competition and I want to always challenge myself to do better and better. There is no greater challenge in life than Survivor, I must conquer it.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Because of the life I have already survived. It was a crazy rough neighborhood I grew up in, but I made it out and I have even traveled to 30 countries since then. I am also a beast at physical challenges. I have a very strong social game and, thanks to my poker skills, I will be able to read people well and will blindside the ""blindsiders."" I will be able to break hearts when I need to, even my own. The relationships will be real, but the ultimate goal will always be Sole Survivor.[2]

Current residence: Durham, North Carolina
Occupation: Law Student
Hobbies: Running, skiing, biking, hiking, reading, board games, traveling, and balling out for delicious meals.
Pet peeves: Being unwantedly touched, heavy breathing, slow walkers and slow talkers, people who are unprepared at airport security, rule-breakers, and the assumption that men and women can't be platonic friends.
Three words to describe you: Competitive, resilient, and vibrant.
What accomplishment are you most proud of? Teaching middle school for five years. Thanks to the two schools where I taught, my two incredible department heads, and my 400+ impressive students, I'll forever be that person who says that teaching was the hardest but most rewarding job she's ever had.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My family. I am the oldest of four and the oldest of my 13 first cousins, and we all genuinely enjoy each other's company. My family inspires me to take on new challenges, but also to remain grounded, remember my roots, and to be someone they can be proud of. I have the confidence to do things like go on Survivor because of the stability and love both my parents have provided and continue to provide.
What's one thing we wouldn't know from seeing a photo of you? My all-time favorite TV protagonist is Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks. Also, I can read tarot cards.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Parvati (who is the most obvious selection that everyone strives to be) because she was charming as she was being manipulative. She allowed herself to be grouped into a ""dumb girl alliance"" but controlled the social situation throughout. I also relate to Wendell. Like Wendell, I am able to remain emotionally neutral and find humor in stressful or irritating situations.
What's your primary motivation for being on Survivor? I have wanted to compete on Survivor since I first watched Elisabeth Filarski jump off that cliff in the Australian Outback. Now that it's happening (!!!), I keep reminding myself that the show is for money and not just an adventure. I want a behind-the-scenes look at the show I love, and I want to test my mind, body, and social prowess. The opportunity to graduate law school with zero debt is a bonus.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am smart, strong, and not annoying. Discomfort and being dirty don't bother me. I can fit in anywhere and form relationships with anyone. Being an oldest child and being a teacher taught me how to manage chaos, how to be adaptable and considerate to others' needs, and how to use subtle powers of persuasion to get people to do what I want.[3]

Age: 27
Hometown: Merced, California
Current residence: Palo Alto, California
Occupation: Admissions Counselor
Hobbies: Singing, photography, thrifting, and hunting for cool/unique cafes.
Pet peeves: When people are flaky and do not follow through with their promises. When people don't understand that the middle seat passenger has rights to both armrests. When people tell me, ""Wow! Your English is really good!"" and follow with, ""Where did you learn English?"" When people dismiss and/or invalidate my lived experience as a person of color.
Three words to describe you: Shamelessly-me, quick-witted, and not-afraid-to-flip-tables.
What accomplishment are you most proud of? It might seem a bit trivial, but I am most proud of buying my mother a new and modern refrigerator for Mother's Day in 2017. She and my father were not able to afford new appliances and had been using the same old refrigerator for 12 years, so it was really meaningful for me to buy her something she really wanted and needed.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Like so many children of refugees, I am here today because of my parents' sacrifices. My father's journey was especially harrowing. He, Txooj Zeb Muas, is my hero and quite literally, a true survivor. Faced with unknown odds, he risked everything to have a chance at living. At 16 years old, my father and his two cousins ran from the mountains of Laos—through jungles laced with landmines and buzzing with bullets from communist Viet Cong and Pathet Lao followers—to refugee camps in Thailand in an attempt to escape ethnic genocide of the Hmong and Mien people who were abandoned after being recruited for guerilla warfare. After miraculously making it across the Mekong River and into the camps, he was relocated to Montana with nothing more than the clothes on his back. Despite the struggles of being forced into a totally foreign country with no immediate family members, he has never given up on living life to its fullest potential. I have had the privilege of growing up without the fears of being exposed to Agent Orange, ethnic persecution, and displacement because of his resilience, his perseverance, his defiance, and his traumatic experiences.
What's one thing we wouldn't know from seeing a photo of you? In 2015, after years of experiencing erratic and frightening out-of-body panic-attack-like episodes, my grandmother's Shaman Master declared that I was, and am, the next shaman to rise in our family!
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Vince is Vince. Survivor ain't never had anyone like me before, haha. IF I had to choose, I'd say a mix of Shii Ann Huang, because she didn't let nobody mess with her. The Shii Devil, Cirie Fields, because she's humble, analytical, strategic, and inspirational, and Natalie Anderson, because she was loyal, innovative, and an overall boss!
What's your primary motivation for being on Survivor? Honestly, I am here to show minority young folk and people across the world that they matter, that their stories and narratives are important, and that they should never doubt their existence regardless of what others say. Survivor has been an integral part of my life. It showed me that a kid from Merced could dream of traveling abroad, take big risks, and be more than another statistic. I hope that winning the title of ""Sole Survivor"" inspires other kids to challenge the oppressive systems and institutions that seek to keep them down!
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I have accumulated grit from the challenges that I've faced throughout my life and have always been able to gain the trust and confidence of others. I believe I can use my unassuming image and 209 vernacular to fool others into believing that I am not an immediate threat. However, I'd say I'm pretty crafty and will be able to use my smarts to create plans and execute votes that will eliminate anyone I feel is a threat to my game (if you're not with me, you're dead to me). I also understand how to deal with big egos and personal quirks and can use my social skills to build confidence among all characters. Lastly, I've got quite a mouth and can smack the Jury with an award-winning Final Tribal Council speech to guarantee my win.[2]

Pet peeves: The chunky dad sneakers trend that suddenly made a comeback and makes it look like you have bricks strapped to your feet. Bulky, unflattering, and yet ""everyone"" is wearing them. Why suddenly, after we all agreed to put these to bed, have these dad sneakers come back?
Three words to describe you: Driven, competitive, and scrappy.
What accomplishment are you most proud of? Getting on Survivor. I started applying to the show when I was 21, and I remember believing once I put in that application, Survivor would be chomping at the bit to invite me to play this game. Little did I know at that point that this would be the start to a very long journey. After almost six straight years of applying, with rejection after rejection after rejection, I finally contemplated throwing in the towel. Yet, as hard as I tried to push it away, I could never get the thoughts and urges to play out of my mind and out of my heart. I've never quit anything in my life, and I'm so proud of myself for never giving up on my dream, despite people telling me to do so. The best thing I ever did was believe in myself.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Larry David because he respects wood.
What's one thing we wouldn't know from seeing a photo of you? I'm pretty, pretty, pretty good.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? Parvati and Kelley Wentworth, although I am aware the two girls play very different games. Parvati plays a very social, flirty, unsuspecting game, and establishes herself in power when she can. Kelley plays a very sneaky, threatening and aggressive game, tends to be more in your face with what she wants to accomplish, with a ""never give up"" type of attitude. I see myself in both of them.
What's your primary motivation for being on Survivor? It's the allure of this really amazing game, this game I've been dreaming of playing since I was 8 years old. This game that will strip me down to my core, while also offering myself the opportunity to prove what I'm capable of. To all the superfans out there, never give up.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I've been underestimated my entire life, and the second you tell me I can't do something, I'm going to do my damnedest to prove everyone wrong. I know what it's like to be at the bottom. Things might not always go my way, but I've learned to push through the challenges and work my way to the top. I'm tenacious, a hard worker, and I don't take anything for granted. Applying to the show for so many years has made me stronger, and hungrier to win. I have something to prove, and I will win because I have the passion and desire to do so.[2]

I have a deep and fundamental understanding of human communication and connection. I have an uncanny ability to make strangers feel at ease. I disarm them with humor and self-deprecation. But I reinforce the connections with true and sincere interest and care. I will build relationships that will not only take me further into the game, but will win me the votes at Final Tribal Council. Second, I will take control of my game and lead my allies to make favorable decisions to my game. I am a natural leader. Third, I will outwork my competition; I am an animal. I am resilient and hardworking. When I start something, I NEED to finish it.[2]

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I can navigate anyone and every social scenario. I understand I will be a target for people, and I do not take that lightly.

What accomplishment are you most proud of? My educational path is something I'm most proud of. After 8 years at P.S. 27, a Jersey City public school where my mom is still a teacher, I was accepted to the Prep for Prep program in New York. That experience prepared me for high school at Milton Academy, a New England prep school, which opened the door for me to attend and graduate from Brown University, an Ivy League school in Providence, R.I. With some bumps along the way and lots of help from those who care about me, I was able to make it through and be where I am today.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Barack Obama. I wasn't all that politically aware prior to his run for president. He spoke to me. He inspired me to get involved and care about our world in a more engaged way. I've read his books, watched his speeches, and followed his presidency.

Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I would say if you combined David Wright's strategy, Davie's social game, and a pinch of Amanda Kimmel's likeability. These three players were fans of the game, played hard, and did everything they could do with the hands they were dealt.
What's your primary motivation for being on Survivor? I am on the show to do something most people dream about. I am there to win the game and get the million dollars. Those are my only motivations. If I happen to make people smile and help them escape whatever hardships are going on in their lives for an hour a week, that is a huge plus too.
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I am physical and can win challenges, but that won't win Survivor. What wins Survivor is the time spent opening up and connecting to people. When you have real connections with people they will keep you around longer. Also, I am there to win the game. I see myself finding idols, making moves and leading blindsides.[2]

Age: 43Previous seasons of Survivor: Marquesas, All-Stars, Heroes vs. Villains, Redemption Island (winner)What specific accomplishments do you think ultimately earned you the moniker of ""Idol"" when it comes to Survivor? I've played Survivor four times over the course of nearly two decades. I have seen the evolution of the game and I am proficient in the three main aspects of the game: the social component, the physical component, and the strategic/psychological component. I wouldn't necessarily call myself an idol—I didn't come up with that idea—but I definitely know what I'm doing!What do you think you can teach the new castaways to help them become Sole Survivor? I understand the basics: everything from how to start a fire, build a shelter, and catch fish. And the more complex, social dynamics of the game—and of course, different strategic approaches.

How will being a mentor present a different challenge for you than actually competing in the game? I think the hardest thing about being a mentor for myself is not being able to actually compete. I am competitive by nature, so to stand on the sidelines and watch the game being played is going to be difficult.Given that you're not playing Survivor in the traditional sense, what element of the game are looking forward to NOT having to endure? The fact that they can't vote me off will give me time to really enjoy the survival aspect of the game (camp life). My background is in construction so I plan to concentrate on building the ultimate shelter. The best one Survivor has ever seen![5]

Age: 45
Previous seasons of Survivor: Pearl Islands (winner), Heroes vs. Villains (winner), Game Changers
What specific accomplishments do you think ultimately earned you the moniker of ""Idol"" when it comes to Survivor? This is probably the easiest question to answer. I am considered an Idol because I am the only castaway to ever win the game twice and to this day that has never happened again. I won the first season I ever appeared on back in 2003 and also won the second season I ever appeared on back in 2010. I'm not an Idol because I say I'm an Idol, but because my record proves it. Nine years ago and 19 seasons ago I became known as the Queen, and to this day no one has ever come close to tying my record.
What do you think you can teach the new castaways to help them become Sole Survivor? I'm an open book when it comes to the seasons I've played in. I plan on sharing all aspects of the game with the castaways. I will be able to discuss situations like being flexible and how to go with the flow when you have no control over what the majority wants to do at a given time. How to build a strong alliance, by trusting people you genuinely like and share common interests with. And that no one is perfect, there's no way to play a perfect game, so when you make a mistake, own it.
What part of the game do you think new castaways usually underestimate? The new castaways underestimate how hard the social part of the game truly is. Hard because there's people you will automatically like and people you will automatically dislike. With those you like, you immediately build a bond and trust, yet there can only be one winner. It's easy to vote off people you dislike, but when all those people are gone, now you have to start voting off the ones you consider friends. And these are the friends that you just blindsided and 100 percent of the time are upset that you voted them off and yet you still have to also convince them to give you the million dollar prize. It's really a juggling act.
How will being a mentor present a different challenge for you than actually competing in the game? Being a mentor is actually easier than playing the game, because you don't have to focus on the daily aspects of Survivor. I know I'm not playing for the million dollars. I know I will not participate in any challenges (hooray). And I know I will never enter the game in some crazy twist. All I have to do is get to know the new players, listen to them carefully, and advise them. In other words, I plan on sharing the knowledge I have gained after playing for 94 consecutive days. I'm going to provide guidance, but at the end of the day each person has to make their own decisions and play their own game.

Given that you're not playing Survivor in the traditional sense, what element of the game are looking forward to NOT having to endure? I'm over the moon knowing I don't have to endure a single challenge the entire season.[4]

Age: 33
Hometown: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Current residence: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Occupation: Furniture Company Owner
Hobbies: Playing basketball, traveling, creating something from nothing.
Pet peeves: People who aren't open-minded despite facts/logic/new information, people that overuse the word ""honestly,"" and not being in control of my destiny.
Three words to describe you: Witty, intelligent, and competitive.
What's your personal claim to fame? I left a comfortable job in the legal field to pursue my dreams.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? My family. I'd do anything for them or to make their lives better.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? First, my brush to take care of my beautiful beard and fro. Second, a chainsaw so I can make building things a lot easier, and finally, a sketchbook so I can doodle, draw, and write.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I think I'd play the game like Jeremy Collins because I'll always keep my heart in the right place, but I'll still be a serious competitor and threat.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I've been a big fan for a while, and I've always wanted to push myself to the limits and see if I can really survive. Oh yeah, I'm playing for the million bucks, too. That would really help things.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I'm good with people and likable. I'm very diplomatic and can connect with people from different walks of life. I'm also not the biggest and strongest looking person, though I can compete with the best of them. That will get me past the first few votes.

Name: Adam Klein
Age: 25
Current residence: San Francisco, CA
Occupation: Homeless shelter manager
Tribe designation: Vanua (Millennials)
Three words to describe you: Intelligent, confident, and personable.
Hobbies: Board games, poker, browsing the Survivor Subreddit, and travel.
Pet peeves: Bullies, long lines, and smokers.
What does it mean to be a Millennial? Millennials believe that, in this moment, anything is possible. If you have dreams, go after them. If you want to change the world, change it. I don't believe you have to ""pay your dues"" making copies and fetching coffee before you can be successful—or before you can make a difference. Don't just work harder, work smarter, and make your goals a reality! My dream is to win Survivor and I'm going to make it happen!
Personal claim to fame: As a volunteer, I chaired a Relay For Life event that raised over $135,000 for cancer research and grew in size from about 10 youth participants to over 500. If any of that money helps save my mom's life, then it is, by far, my most important accomplishment.
Inspiration in life: My mom. She is surviving lung cancer and has survivorship in her blood [because] her mom survived Auschwitz. She is incredibly physically fit and otherwise healthy. She can tear up the dance floor—that's where I get my moves!—and she's my best friend and supporter.
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A picture of my family to keep myself grounded and focused, a fake Hidden Immunity Idol because the threat can be just as powerful as the real thing, and a razor because I hate mustaches with a fiery passion.
Survivor contestant you're most like: Spencer Bledsoe (Cagayan, Cambodia). We are both wise beyond our years, can easily play up to the egos of older and stronger players, are strategic thinkers, and are widely underestimated in the game. I also relate to the never-say-die nature and social finesse of Hayden Moss (Blood vs. Water).
Reason for being on Survivor: When I set a goal in life, I achieve it. As an ultimate super-duper fan, winning Survivor is an unrealized goal that I simply must accomplish. I have dreamed of winning Survivor since I was 9 years old, even going so far as to play Survivor online when I was in middle school. The money is secondary, but not unimportant because it would allow me to continue my passion for social justice.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? No one is going to fight as hard as I will for that title. I may be—and look—young, I may be small, but my fellow competitors won't know what kind of power punch I pack until they are already knocked out. I will use my youthful charm and energy, combined with my strategic nature to win. I come from a long line of real-life survivors, and I am next.[3]

Why you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor: I am strong and athletic (play soccer, softball and basketball) and I am an extremely good skier.

Why you think you will be the Sole Survivor: I am tough, smart and driven. People will trust and like me even though they should not.

Reason for Being on Survivor: Truly for the thrill of it! Stepping away from the comfort of my little world and challenging myself. Proving I can do as well at this game as I've always thought I could.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: My mental toughness, wicked throwing arm (for a girl), and people sometimes underestimate my sneakiness.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I believe in treating all people with respect and honor. Why would you vote off someone who respects you?[3]

Age: 27
Hometown: Williamsburg, Kentucky
Current residence: Williamsburg, Kentucky
Occupation: Public Defender
Hobbies: Boating on the lake, four-wheeler riding, and tailgating football games and Keeneland horse races.
Pet peeves: People getting offended over every little thing and know-it-alls.
Three words to describe you: Charming, outgoing, and intelligent.
What's your personal claim to fame? Becoming a Redneck Lawyer! I am a first generation college student and the first in my family to get a bachelor degree. I am also proud of myself for being a public defender to help people instead of chasing money—especially because money and the thought of being rich motivated me in school.
Who or what is your inspiration in life? Mamaw Joan—my grandma. She is the most selfless person I've ever met. When my mom and dad got divorced she raised me and my four siblings while we stayed with my dad. She taught me life-changing lessons like the value of hard work and the importance of helping others. She also taught me how to enjoy a beer and some bluegrass music. Work hard, play hard, love hard. Her favorite quote was, ""If you don't use it, you lose it!""
If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? A cooler, beer, and a radio. Nothing beats being outdoors and putting a few back. As great as it is at a tailgate, on the lake, or at a bonfire, I bet it would be even more enjoyable on the beaches of Fiji.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? J.T. from Tocantins, Heroes vs. Villains, and Game Changers. I've got that Southern charm. I can be hard headed when in the heat of a competition. I'll either win or get myself sent home with a massive swing for the fences. No regrets!
What's your reason for being on Survivor? I think there are three reasons people play Survivor: adventure, money, and fame. My primary motivation is the experience and adventure! It has been my dream to play this game since I was a little kid. I want to push myself even further in life then I already have and test myself. My secondary motivation is the money. If I had a million dollars, I could pay off my student loans, which would open up my career options a little more. Money is not my primary motivation, because I anticipate I will make a million dollars in my career at some point. I do not care about fame. These days, Survivor contestants are only famous for about six months, anyways.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? I know I could be the final Survivor because I am the total package for this game, First, I am an adamant, hard-working son of a gun. I have chased my dreams my whole life and achieved those, despite humble beginnings. Second, I am a likeable, social guy. Third, I am physically fit and stronger than I look. I will do great in the challenges—tribal and individual, physical and puzzle. Fourth, I am very smart and it is hidden well behind my accent and appreciation for small town life. I will definitely be underestimated. Finally, I am a Survivor strategy expert. I am a super fan who has analyzed every season and every move. As I said, I am the Survivor total package.[1]

Personal Claim to Fame: The decision to leave the safety and stability of my previous job to open my own business is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment. It took planning and preparation to make that transition smooth and successful. It also took some serious courage to risk the financial security I had.
Inspiration in Life: At this point in my life, I struggle to identify any one hero, but a hero in my eyes is someone who follows their passion.
Hobbies: Sprint triathlons, reading and playing dress up/goofing off with my kiddo.
Pet Peeves: My number one pet peeve is laziness and people who expect that change will happen without them having to put in any real level of effort. Life is what you make it folks... dig deep!
3 Words to Describe You: Determined, energetic and goofy.
If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why?
1) A seriously sturdy jogging bra – no one needs to see my 40 year-old ta-ta's dangling out. This is for function, not fashion.
2) My baseball cap or pink dew rag – sheer comfort and a reflection of who I really am.
3) My favorite picture of my husband and daughter for motivation and connection with them.
Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: I really like Stephenie from Survivor: Palau. If that wasn't ""digging deep"" I don't know what is. She has sheer will power and determination. That is what drives me.
Reason for Being on Survivor: Believe it or not, for the experience!
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: At work, I have to be able to engage and connect on some level with every person who walks through my door. I'm also a worker bee who will seek out ways to help camp life run smoothly.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I have a job that requires the ability to engage people to share very personal information and gain their trust to know it will remain confidential. Survivor will require that same skill set and honestly, I'm good at it. My motto in business, life and now Survivor is ""keep it simple, keep it smart.""[1]

If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? My cowboy hat, my boots, and my running shoes.
Which Survivor contestant are you most like? I'm a mix of Russell Hantz, Boston Rob, and Joe Anglim. I'm a little conniving and manipulative like Russell, have the determination and confidence of Boston Rob, and the athletic ability of Joe.
What's your reason for being on Survivor? Winning a million dollars and being on an island and living with nothing.

Why do you think you'll ""survive"" Survivor? Because I have survived and overcome so many situations and met so many different people with different personalities. My social game is on point and my leadership and survival skills have been tried, tested, and proven.[2]

How have you changed since the last time you played? I'm more cut-throat now. I'm not out there to make friends and I'm willing to go against my word.
What skills do you bring to Survivor that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? I'm a hard worker. I have a great social game. I can fish and hunt. I'm not lazy or stupid. I'm athletic.
What are you most proud of from the last time? I feel like I had so much game left. I'm not really proud of the way I played. I chose my word and loyalty over $1 million. I would not make that mistake again.
What, if anything, do you most regret? I regret sticking to my morals and values. It's Survivor—you have to play the game!

How will you play differently this time? I will do whatever it takes to win. The only purpose for me going back out there is to win a million dollars. I don't care about making friends or what anyone thinks of me. They'll get over it.[2]

Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: Parvati. She was able to read people and form alliances that took the spotlight off of her. She took respectable chances, never silenced herself to get further, and dominated in challenges.
Reason for Being on Survivor: The adventure junky in me wants take myself out of my comfort zone, but ultimately, I'm applying to win. It's all about the money, honey! My car shakes at any speed over 50 mph so I desperately need to replace that tin can.
Why You Think You'll ""Survive"" Survivor: My positivity. I wouldn't let anything dampen my spirit. Enthusiasm is electric, and that attitude would shape the tone around camp. I may be a Jersey girl, but don't let that fool you. I have no problem roughin' it.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor: I've watched every season, so I know what it takes to be successful on this show. Using my charm, I think I can build strong relationships and lead an alliance without being viewed as aggressive. My social awareness will help me understand and use people's strengths, weaknesses and motives to my advantage. I'm not gonna play on the sidelines. I want to make big, badass moves that will get me further in the game, and have fun doing it.[3]

Age: 42

Previously played on: Season 28: Brawn vs. Brains vs. Beauty, Winner
How have you changed since the last time you played? I'm older and much wiser. Just kidding. I'm older, but definitely not wiser. You will see the same guy in this season as you saw in Cagayan.
What skills do you bring to Survivor that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? Unfortunately, the skills I bring to Survivor are skills that will NOT make me a useful member. Instead, they will make me a very threatening member. I haven't learned any new skills since I played on Cagayan, which could be my downfall going back on an all returnee season. I wish I could have learned the skill of being able to be quiet and try to play under the radar, but I don't see that happening. It's just not in my DNA.
What are you most proud of from the last time? WINNING!!
What, if anything, do you most regret? There is seriously nothing I regret. Everything I did on Cagayan was on the fly. Some things were based off of emotion, some based off of strategy, but nothing was based off of malice. In the end, it all fell into place and I became the Sole Survivor.

How will you play differently this time? Going into the game this time around, with all the players knowing my game style, I know that I'm going to be a huge threat. Having said that, I know I will have to take it down a few notches until I can plant my roots. Knowing myself, I won't be able to take it down any notches and will be in trouble. I hope I have what it takes to adapt right away and ""go with the flow""—if that's even possible for me to do. I will have my fingers crossed for sure![2]

Three Words to Describe You: Open-minded, optimistic, confident
Pet Peeves: People who have characteristics of being slothful, condescending, and sycophantic
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? My daughter as she is the next generation in our family.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I love scuba diving. I enjoy examining the surface of the moon, stars or passing comets with my very own telescope.
Who is your hero and why? My hero is my grandfather, a man that didn't have to say a word to speak volumes. I would watch him walk into a room and respect was given to him before he uttered a word. He showered his grandchildren with affection and love that can only be given from the heart. The lessons that he shared with me were instrumental in my development and made me into the man I am today. My grandfather passed during my third week of basic Air Force training, but he remains a constant figure in my life.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would construct a hybrid playing style of Richard Hatch and Wendell Holland with a touch of Boston Rob.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I was taught to always dream big and shoot higher than you know you can do. Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors, try to be better than yourself. The game is not only my motivation, it's my tool to show myself that I can be the Sole Survivor.[2]

Age: 24
Hometown: Sherman Oaks, Calif.
Current Residence: Boston, Mass.
Occupation: Healthcare consultant
Hobbies: Poker, aerial silks and trapeze, cooking, and baking
Three Words to Describe You: Astute, resilient, witty
Pet Peeves: Loud chewing and chewing with an open mouth. Uncleanliness. Really crude humor; manners go a long way.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I got a summer internship at a company my junior year of college and I had been dreaming of working at the company for years. When I got there, they presented me with an engineering problem that they had three full-time senior engineers working on before I got there for the summer. None of them had been able to figure out this problem. I was there for 12 weeks and figured out the solution to this problem in 8 weeks, after having been told that they did not expect me to be able to figure it out. I am so proud of this moment because not only did I prove everyone wrong, I also made a direct impact on the lung cancer diagnostic device the project was for. I lost my grandfather to lung cancer, so I am proud of myself for making a difference in this field.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I have so many layers. I come off as super-sweet, but I am tough and have the biggest fighting spirit you will ever see. I am absolutely a force to be reckoned with and I feel bad for the people who underestimate me. No one who looks at me realizes how smart I am just by seeing me. I am young, but I have been through some tough things in my life and have learned how to bounce back from adversity.
Who is your hero and why? My grandmother. She passed away in April 2020 from COVID and she fought alone, and all the way to the end. She did not have an easy life at all. She fought for absolutely everything that was hers and never gave up. She also treated everyone with so much love and kindness and never expected anything back from anyone. My grandmother's ability to bounce back from hit after hit that life threw at her is so inspiring to me and all I want to do with my life is be someone that she would be proud of.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Kim Spradlin. She actually took the time to get to know the other people, which made her more personable. She also used this to her advantage because she knew exactly how to get into their heads. She made people feel like they were the ones making the moves, successfully diverting the target from her back. Kim was also so strong and kicked butt in Immunity Challenges, which I definitely think that I can also do on the show.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I don't think there has ever been someone on the show with the same physicality, intelligence and social awareness that I have. I love talking to and bonding with people and in order to win Survivor, you have to know how to connect with people on a human level. I am very good at reading a room and know when someone is lying to me. I also have the physical strength and fighting spirit that I know will push me to never give up and always give everything I have. I am incredibly tough, both mentally and physically, and I believe I will thrive in the environment of the game. I'm not going to tell anyone I went to MIT and I think I will be underestimated, which I will use to my advantage. With my ability to genuinely connect with people, brains and physical strength, I could definitely be the final Survivor.[2]

Age: 35
Hometown: Highland, Calif.
Current Residence: Chicago, Ill.
Occupation: Neurosurgeon
Hobbies: Traveling, snowboarding, eating
Three Words to Describe You: Determined, passionate, stubborn
Pet Peeves: My pet peeves revolve around people's incompetence, laziness and lack of self-awareness. When you work an insane number of hours in a week, you just can't tolerate pure ineptness.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Hands down I'm most proud of becoming a neurosurgeon that focuses on treating the brain cancer that claimed my father's life. No one in my family is in healthcare and no one in my family has left our area in Southern California. Becoming a physician, let alone a neurosurgeon, just wasn't something that was done in my community and was not something that seemed achievable as a kid.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? Despite a confident exterior, I still have and process a lot of emotional baggage. As with all neurosurgeons, I have a ""trail of tears"" that I have to cope with on a routine basis.
Who is your hero and why? My mom is my hero. She raised me and my sister herself after my father passed. She has sacrificed so much and worked so hard so that I could shoot for my dreams. She never pressured me to do or be anything; she just wanted me to be the best that I could be.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would play with a similar aggressive nature as Russell Hantz. He was aggressive, but his social assimilation needed work. Todd Herzog had a brilliant social game. He did in final tribal what Russell couldn't. I know how to pander to people and make them feel valuable even if I don't believe it. I would dominate in final tribal. Natalie Anderson also had a brilliant social game, she made big moves and covered her tracks perfectly. Kelley Wentworth was aggressive and had an uncanny ability to read her surroundings, and so do I. Cirie Fields is the master of this game If she was a little more athletic, she would dominate. Her social ability and her social awareness is amazing. She relates to people and makes them feel comfortable. She's calm and doesn't appear to be overly aggressive.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor?  I will be the Sole Survivor because I possess an ideal balance of charm, wit, athleticism and grit. Neurosurgery training has prepared me to push myself physically and emotionally beyond what is normal. As a neurosurgeon I have to be charming, relatable and able to connect with my patients, who place their identity and lives literally in my hands. I know how to be cool under stress. In neurosurgery the stakes are incredibly high and the only person I can trust to get the job done is myself. In Survivor, you always have to assume that people are trying to screw you over. I am extremely athletic and work out twice a day. However, I am not a ""jock"" or ""golden boy"" like Joey Amazing, Malcolm or Ozzy, who will always be targets because of their persona. I can also be extremely eloquent and persuasive — my Final Tribal Council will rival the likes of Todd Herzog's.[2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? My family. I'm very proud of my wife of 21 years and 4 kids.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I'm a private pilot and enjoy flying. I've nearly died from a rattlesnake bite, been blown up by a propane tank and I like to live life on the edge.
Who is your hero and why? My dad. I worked side by side with him nearly every day my entire life. He was a father, boss and friend and, even after battling cancer for five years, he always kept a positive, generous attitude.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Boston Rob. We don't have the same personality, but his thoughtful, strategic play is how I see myself playing.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor?  I have all the skills of a typical rancher — hard-working, common sense-but I'm completely different because of my social skills. I believe I can build multidimensional alliances and win trust with most people, but with laser vision towards the end goal.[2]

Three Words to Describe You: High energy, charming, charismatic
Pet Peeves: I really hate bullies, and I don't like loud eating.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?  I'm so proud to be a two-time state track champion because it is the culmination of seven years of absolute passion, but also pain. Literal blood, sweat and tears! Everyone will tell you running is hard, but running with the fastest people in the state running sub five minute miles and pole vaulting is a story of its own.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? When people first meet me they always assume I'm the goofy, go with the flow bro who's here to make you laugh. But I'm also a lot smarter than people think until they see my grades or hear me speak in front of a crowd. I did Toastmasters, a nonprofit educational organization that teaches public speaking and leadership, when I was in 6th grade up until high school, so I can speak eloquently. Public speaking has never been a problem for me.
Who is your hero and why? Every now and then I volunteer at the children's hospital because pediatric nursing is what I want to do with the rest of my life. Those kids are absolutely my heroes. To know and see what they go through hurts, and yet they still have a smile on their faces. Why would I — someone in perfect health — spend so much time being angry at dumb stuff like bad weather, girls or no more milk in my fridge? I'm so much more privileged than they are. I will always have a smile on my face and a laugh on the way because why not, right?
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would love to play the game like the culmination of some great Survivor winners, specifically Parvati, Fabio and Jeremy Collins. No one in the history of Survivor can charm like Parv. I'm going to change that. I would love to have Fabio's ability to be underestimated, which I believe is the best thing you can be in Survivor. Lastly, I want to work Jeremy's shield management into my gameplay while still having my own king spin on it.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I believe that there are numerous aspects of Survivor. You'll drive yourself mad trying to do one of them perfectly. If I can do everything well enough, I know I can win. I have great social awareness and in high school I was very popular.  I had my hand in every clique with the jocks, the band kids, musical theatre kids, popular kids, rappers, academic kids, ROTC kids, quiet kids, and even the teachers loved me. Even now, I have a great relationship with the president of our college. I have that ""it"" factor that some people just have. I think JT had it and Kim Spradlin, now I have it too.[2]

What is something we would never know from looking at you? I hate brushing my teeth before bed. I never wash my face.
Who is your hero and why? My grandmother is my hero. My mother was her only child and she so gracefully lived through her untimely passing. She was blind to top it all off, yet the smartest and funniest person in the world. She always made me feel loved and she laughed with me all the time. She was literally my alarm clock every morning until she died!
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would play competitively like Ozzy, loyal like Colby (but not to the detriment of my own game), and endearing like Parvati.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I am patient and experienced in seeing the bigger picture. I know when to strike when the iron is hot, so to speak. I can read people in a minute and read their energy![3]

Age: 37
Hometown: Sri Lanka
Current Residence: Morgan Hill, Calif.
Occupation: Sales manager
Hobbies: Cricket, traveling, cooking
Three Words to Describe You: Authentic, outgoing, hardworking
Pet Peeves: Laziness and people who don't contribute to group efforts
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I have achieved the American Dream. I grew up in poverty, living in a mud hut with no electricity or running water for half my life. I never held a cell phone or touched a computer until I was 18. I worked my way up from selling vegetables on the street to making multi-million-dollar sales for my company. I taught myself English. I am able to give my kids the life I didn't have growing up and still fully support my family back in Sri Lanka. I was able to help send my sister to college and support the education of my nieces and nephew. I recently saved enough money to buy land in Sri Lanka, where I hope to build my mom a more modern, safer home.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? People would never know that I grew up in a remote village and didn't experience modern conveniences or technology until I was grown. I didn't know how to use a real toilet or shower until I was 18 and moved overseas (in Sri Lanka, we had a hole in the ground in an outhouse for a toilet and bathed in the river behind the house). We washed our clothes in the river. I didn't get my driver's license (or really drive a car) until my wife — then girlfriend — helped me get one in Dubai when I was 26.
Who is your hero and why? My mom is absolutely my hero. She has sacrificed everything for her children. When I was young and my father was ill, she had to make the immensely difficult decision to leave behind three young children to go work in a foreign country as a housemaid. She suffered and was mistreated there, but she did what she had to do to keep us fed.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I think I'm pretty original and not too similar to anyone who has played before. I have some aspects of former players, like my jungle skills and an engaging personality, but I think I'm unique and will bring something new and refreshing to the game.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I am a strong competitor. I have a unique and engaging personality and believe my tribe would want to keep me because I can provide, win challenges and keep them entertained. I will do whatever it takes to win. This game is so important to me and winning it would be my greatest achievement. I have unique life experiences that will help me to make it to the end.[2]

Current Residence: Arlington, Massachusetts

Hobbies: Cooking, biking, being in nature (hiking, camping, swimming in ponds)
Three Words to Describe You: Extroverted, enthusiastic, smart
Pet Peeves: Men. Not all men, but I cannot stand machismo and man-splainers — anything like that drives me insane. [In grad school] I deal with A LOT of know-it-all male energy, and it's a lot. Back when I dated men, I once broke up with a guy because we were on a trip to Budapest and he kept pronouncing it ""Budah-pesht"" to prove how smart and worldly he was, and it was the biggest turnoff. I broke up with him literally 30 minutes after we got back from the trip.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? In February 2019 I was featured in an episode of the podcast Radiolab (episode ""Asking for a Friend""). I was so proud of it for several reasons. One, I absolutely love that podcast and it was so freaking cool to be a part of it. Two, I felt like I was really able to bring a lot of myself into the interview. Normally, scientists try to keep things very clinical and sterile. That's not my attitude. We talked about Neanderthals, but in the discussion, I also brought up the fact that we always seem to imagine Neanderthals as males when of course they were females as well. The reporter said, ""Oh maybe I should be imagining myself meeting a female Neanderthal at a bar."" Naturally, I replied, ""Well that's my kind of story.""  She ran with it and had a whole chunk of the episode be about queer interspecies romance, which is literally my dream come true.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? People are normally shocked that I passed as straight for 23 years. I give off the vibe of someone super confident in my queerness (which I am now), but it wasn't always this way. I like to be loud and proud about that so people know that it's okay to take longer to know yourself. People who know me at all are also often incredibly surprised when I say that I'm 5'2"". People are always surprised that I'm short. I have a big personality that takes up more than 62 inches of space.
Who is your hero and why? My hero is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She is just such a badass woman and withstands so much hate, sexism, racism, ageism and somehow never gives up or gives in. I so admire the way that she stands up for regular people and against huge opposition from powerful forces with just her voice, passion and beliefs. I genuinely cried when watching her speech after a Republican congressman called her a bitch. She stood there in Congress, so poised and dignified, yet still so clearly channeling intense fiery passion against abusive men and for women everywhere who have to deal with that BS. She said, ""Having daughters is not what makes someone a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect is what makes a decent man."" That's just so true and clear and makes me feel seen by a politician for the first time ever.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I think the strategy that would work well for me would be staying close to the center of power, but never directly perceived as the one making the calls. For example, Todd at the beginning of China put Aaron as the leader of his tribe, but knew he could control him. I also think Natalie in San Juan del Sur crushed this. She was Jeremy's number two at first, so he was the one that got cut while she stuck around. Then she pretended to let Jon Misch et al. be in charge. Ultimately, she struck at the right time and was able to get him out and win. I think that would be the type of player I would want to be — I'd want to seem agreeable and like I wasn't playing with intense strategy, but be right next to the front-man so that I could grab the reins at the right moment. This plan could blow up if you're too in love with the front-man (à la Stephen with J.T. or any non-Kim players in One World). You have to know when to betray them.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor?  I really think I have the right combination of skills to win the game. I'm extremely smart and strategic and know the game very well and will constantly be thinking about how to put myself in the best position to win. But I'm also so silly and goofy and physically small and clumsy that I think people will really underestimate me and not target me. I've got an infectious smile and personality that will help me make great bonds with people. I'm super open and vulnerable with people so I think people will feel close to me, tell me information and want to work with me. I think people will have warm feelings for me at the end of the game even if I vote them out. I'm good at reading people's vibes and am very sensitive to shifts in people's energy so I think I'll be able to figure out if people are lying to me or planning to betray me. Even though I am very empathetic to people, I also can have a wall up in me and always put my closest people above anyone else, and I know I will be able to betray someone for the sake of winning the game. I'm also relentlessly optimistic and will not ever give up or count myself out.[3]

The accomplishment that I am MOST proud of is doing the hard work in therapy and confronting my demons, working through the pain and the feelings of injustice, and then being willing to cultivate a relationship with those who let me down when I was little.What is something we would never know from looking at you? I was in a gang.Who is your hero and why? My mom, because I saw her fight her demons until her dying breath. She experienced so much pain in her life, and my childhood was dark, twisted and complicated, but she was an extremely hard-working Italian woman. She always made sure I had a roof over my head and lunch money in my pockets. She did the best she could and I'm grateful. She gave me the best life she knew how and loved me with all the love she had in her.  She is my image of beauty and strength. Also, Xena: Warrior Princess. Lucy Lawless taught me so much about how to be a strong, assertive woman and how to stand up for yourself in a world full of men. She was my childhood hero, posters all over my wall. I even had a Xena: Warrior Princess-themed birthday party… last year.Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I think I am probably going to play the game most like Kim; strategically and relationally like Tai when it comes to idols, but I got some Parv in me too.Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I believe I have what it takes to win. I think living on the streets, developing a strong work ethic, practicing excellence in all that I do and put out into the world, having a high threshold for pain and suffering, endurance, perseverance, knowing that nothing comes easily but everything must be earned and worked for, rigorous self-examination, zero entitlement, trusting that self discipline is self love, believing in others and making them feel capable of accomplishing anything, my interpersonal skills, my wit and my grit, my reverence for God in others, my heart to serve, and an attitude of gratefulness and celebration for the small wins all make me believe that I will be the final Survivor.[2]

Pet Peeves: I hate when people chew with their mouth open.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I am most proud of being invited to perform my spoken word for Congressman John Lewis during a fundraiser for a non-profit organization in my community.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? Looking at me you would never know that I spent a portion of my childhood in Tokyo and Singapore.
Who is your hero and why? My hero is Misty Copeland, the first female African-American dancer to be promoted to a principal dancer for the American Ballet Theatre. I see Misty Copeland as a hero because she faced incredible odds growing up in terms of her home life, but she also stayed committed to her craft and her love of ballet to get where she is today. In staying committed mentally and emotionally to the idea that she could, in fact, be a professional ballet dancer even though she didn't fit the archetype of a white ballerina, she broke barriers for future Black ballet dancers who had dreams that always seemed unattainable.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would hope to play the game most like Tony Vlachos, except not have other people know that. Tony was a player that minimized risks to the best of his ability. He would always read the social scene and crunch numbers, but if he felt like his game was on the line, he would find some way to ensure his safety, whether it was finding an idol or slickly attempting to overhear other players' conversations. Although I really hated when Tony did that as a viewer, I think his type of game play is one that I would try to emulate, but in a way that had more authentic relationships. In all honesty, I would hope to be a type of hybrid between Tony and Elaine. I would have Tony's game play skills and Elaine's people skills.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I believe I can be the final Survivor because too often, women of color are overlooked and undervalued. Whether that's in my business classes dominated by white men who feel entitled to the space they take up or in future workplaces, it is women of color who have nurtured and cared for others throughout history. If there was ever a person who was strong enough mentally, physically and emotionally to take on a game full of odds — a woman of color, a woman like me and the women I come from would be the one to do it.[2]

Three Words to Describe You: Competitive, charismatic, optimistic
Pet Peeve: Lying, not being on time and lack of accountability. Lack of awareness and consideration for people's time and space or having to repeat myself after three times.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Completing my graduate degree program! It was my goal to earn an MBA before I made it to the NFL, but that changed due to the money I was making and the workload that football requires. After retirement, I had to overcome my own mind and doubts that I couldn't do it. It was the hardest thing I've ever done in life — late nights of studying and having tutors almost giving up repeatedly. But I never did, I have my MBA!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? You would never know that I often achieve success because of fear, my fear of letting the people that I love down. Letting down people that took a chance on me is the vision that I use to thrive in competitive situations.  Very similar to Adam Sandler in the movie The Waterboy.
Who is your hero and why? My mom. When my father passed, she was left to take care of three kids alone. She worked two jobs plus side work to provide for us. There is nothing she wouldn't do for us. I take strength to be strong when a tragedy hits from her, she never complained or let us see her cry. She did that for us. I owe her everything that I can give.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?  Ben ""Boom"" Driebergen, 1 Big Move King. I figure that I would be seen as a strong physical player, so I would eventually become a big target. The way Ben was able to outwork everyone on the tribe and do what he needed to do in order to survive was truly admirable.  It's that 'back against the wall' mentality I admire.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor?  I'm applying to win. I always have something to prove to myself. I truly believe that I can succeed at whatever I put my mind to. I haven't failed yet and don't plan on starting now.[2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I've always been willing to make a change, pick up and go. It makes me feel brave to know I've changed my career when unhappy. I've purchased a one-way plane ticket not knowing what to expect, just to audition to dance around the country and succeeded. I've moved alone to new states on a whim. I only have this one life, I don't want to waste it doing what's easy.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I am deaf in one ear. I focus heavily on reading lips and am fluent in ASL.
Who is your hero and why? My husband, Andy. He has navigated through life after many setbacks, struggles and the tragic loss of a parent in a car accident. Andy focused on putting his physical comfort behind his and my desire for our family to grow and carried our children as a transgender man. I cannot think of a better human.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Aubry Bracco, but win.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? The ability to show kindness, but also not take certain attacks and situations seriously feels like most players' downfall. They succumb to the emotions and get voted out. I have awareness of my being while also being very observant of others and loyal, but not to a fault.[2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? With the profit I made with the sale of my first house which I bought all by myself, I was able to pay off the remainder of my student loans and all of my personal debt. Marrying my husband 100 percent debt-free was the absolute best gift to myself. I'm still raising two strong, courageous, kind daughters but I'm sure who they are becoming is undoubtedly going to be my absolute best accomplishment.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I had a very challenging upbringing, have a passion for opossums, and I cuss like a drunken, sunburnt sailor.
Who is your hero and why? I know many heroes. My definition of a hero is anyone who goes against the grain and stands up for what he/she believes, in the face of ridicule, embarrassment and at the risk of being ostracized, all while being his/her true authentic self. I strive to be one and raise two of my own.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Rick Devens — he played so hard with everything he had. Even when it was getting bad, he made his time fun! I want to make my experience a truly fun adventure, even if only for myself. I want to belly laugh when it's so tough. Tina Wesson — she was calculated, direct, but kind. Age and stature and her nurturing persona played in her favor, she inspired me. I'd embody the kindness of Lisa Whelchel, but with the savviness of Chrissy Hofbeck.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I'm sharp and observant, like OCD observant. I'm surprisingly very strong and have a ridiculously high threshold for pain. I'm resilient. I'm daring but careful. I build strong relationships. I'm likable and entertaining. I listen and learn. I will be the person who remembers where everyone is from and what they love on their pizza. I'll know their stories — the kids, pets, etc. I may not like them all, but I have the ability to convince them all that I do! I'll make people smile when they need to. I hope to make all feel included and important.[2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Nike Cross Nationals is the Super Bowl of cross country, and I love that people were baffled that my high school team even qualified. The conditions on race day were grim. The field was hilly, drenched, and oozing mud, the temp was a bone-chilling 40 degrees, it was pouring rain and clearly no place for a Florida boy. Everyone was miserable, but seeing the best of the best riddled with fear and intimidation, I felt a surge of confidence. Despite predictions that we would flop, we placed in the top 10.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I love the pursuit of knowledge and experience. I could spend hours discussing the genius of Richard Serra's commission for the NYC IRS building, or how Mandarin enables the mind to think more creatively, or the lab I just finished on rendering an image of the Crab Nebula using doppler shift and Kepler's Third Law, or an algorithm for my latest app's feed widget, or the golden warmth of the sun as it crests the horizon on a cold morning in Rocky Mountain National Park, or meandering through the crowded bazaars of western China. I want to live a thousand lives before mine is over.
Who is your hero and why? Undoubtedly my dad. That man sacrifices everything for his family and especially for me to live out my exuberant adventures and ambitions. He served in the Navy, Peace Corps, and now serves as a prominent doctor in the Jacksonville community. People adore him, most of all me. Above all, he lets me know he's proud of me and supports me in any direction I want to take my life.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Any of the pretty-boy-challenge-beast-charmers, just take your pick: Jay, Joe, Devon. I think I'd play most like Jay, a fellow Florida boy, using physical powers to get me to the merge, but more importantly making strong bonds, charming all and secretly thinking hyper-strategically.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I will be the final Survivor because I'm the jack-of-all-trades and there's nothing in life that can stop me. If I'm not happy with my situation, I change it and shape the world the way I want to see it. I form deep bonds in every social sphere I encounter and live such a diverse life, there's no one I can't relate to and empathize with. I'm disciplined and won't rest until the million is mine, and no matter what I won't get complacent or cocky.[3]

Pet Peeves: My biggest pet peeve is being told what to do. And it's not something that makes me mildly irritated, I deeply loathe being told what to do. Listen, I'm not saying I know it all, but I'd much rather try and fail at something than go along with what someone else tells me is ""acceptable.""
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Every time I set a new goal and accomplish it, I become most proud of that goal. Most recently, I'm most proud to be in medical school, with a master's and bachelor's degree under my belt. I sense that within this next year I'll be most proud of winning Survivor.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? You'd probably never know that I am very introspective and empathetic. Around people, I am always so outgoing, but I'm also someone who thinks a lot, sometimes overthinks and over feels, for other people and sometimes my own situations. I consider myself an empath, and although I may not always appear to, I do feel other people's emotions, and I do feel strong emotions myself. I think I just do an above average job at concealing these emotions to not look vulnerable.
Who is your hero and why? My heroes are my parents because they truly took parenting personally. They both come from challenging backgrounds and made it their duty to create a better life for my siblings and me. But above all, I find it most heroic that they are and somehow raised five genuinely good human beings, with good hearts and strong moral compasses. That can be hard to come by these days.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Well, I mean let's be real here, my game will be unprecedented! But I see my game being most like Cirie Fields socially and mentally, with a sprinkle of Wendell for pulling out competition wins in the clutch and jury management. I'll be like Cirie and Wendell's love child!
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I believe I could be the final Survivor because of a combination of social, mental and physical skills. I studied the game of Survivor like I would study for a medical school test, and what I have found is that in order to outwit, outplay and outlast, you must have all three skills and these skills must work harmoniously together and shine at different points in the game. I feel like I am self-aware, which is something a lot of people lack. I am analytical enough to pick up on social cues and smart enough to critically think through obstacles that may present themselves, without becoming flustered. I know that I'm physically enough to help my team do well in challenges in the beginning and win challenges past the merge, but also, cunning enough to get any physical threats voted out before the game becomes individual. I am persuasive, but non-threatening. I have street smarts and book smarts, and am empathetic enough to be read as trustworthy. I truly feel like I have the recipe to win![2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? It's hard to pick one because I love my whole life. My goal was to pay off my student loans by 30, and I did it at 27. Doing so allowed me to travel to so many places on my bucket list, get into combat sports and create financial stability for myself. One of my biggest accomplishments is actually leaving my job before coming to Fiji for the game. I'm proud of the career I built for nearly a decade. I'm even more proud that I was brave and walked away when I wasn't passionate about it anymore.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? People are always surprised by how smart and articulate I am. I'm quite smart and figure things out quickly. I'm also quick-witted and those who get it are pleasantly surprised. Those who don't, have no clue what they're missing. People also don't believe I'm 5-feet tall because my vibes make me seem 5'3"".
Who is your hero and why? My grandma. She lived with my family growing up and I have a tattoo inspired by her. She [was] strong willed, so chic, sweet, yet opinionated and caring. She had my back 100 percent of the time. During her final days in the hospital she was still so high-maintenance and always made the nurses put on her pearls and diamonds.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Brenda on the outside, Todd underneath. Brenda is physically strong, socially aware and not afraid to show her teeth. Todd is my all-time favorite player. I can channel his ability to influence others and always be strategically in control of the game and prepare to pitch myself in an amazing jury performance.
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I've been manipulative since before I knew what manipulation was. I relentlessly pursue my dreams. The great thing is no one would expect it because of my youthful face and small stature. I can make it to the end and am confident in my ability to advocate for myself at final tribal.[3]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? At the moment, there's a bunch of academic stuff, like getting into Washington University and winning the Tournament of Champions (the biggest tournament of the year in debate). But for personal accomplishments, I'm really proud of this one sketch I wrote for our spring comedy show, titled ""Skate Park"" There was no trophy or award or anything, but I worked extremely hard on it, and it absolutely killed. It was really rewarding.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I think that a lot of people would assume because I'm young, that I'm naïve or that I have no life experience.

When I was going through tough times, they were always there for me, and I just want to be able to repay them some day. And for non-family hero, Ethan Zohn. He was the first Jewish person I ever saw on TV, which was so insanely cool for 5-year-old me. And beyond that, he's just such an inspirational person.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Todd Herzog. He played a brilliant game in China, where he controlled every single vote from the shadows. We're in a period of Survivor now where the tallest tree is the first one cut; just look at Edge of Extinction's boot order. You need to build a resume, but you can't let anyone realize how extensive your resume is until it's too late. Todd managed to keep his threat-level low while subtly manipulating every facet of the game and revealed everything at Final Tribal Council. I'd also love to mix that with Jeremy's meat shield strategy, so that I'm never the first one targeted if things go awry.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I love all of the core skills that you need to win the game. I'm extremely personable and make friends easily. I'm super intelligent and strategic, with a vast knowledge of the game. I'm athletic enough to not be a liability, but not enough to be a threat. And most importantly, I am willing to work harder than anyone to win. In speech and debate, I competed against hundreds of students from around the country every weekend. These people were just as smart as me, just as well-spoken and just as talented. But I beat them because I worked harder and because I wanted it more. And the same will be true for Survivor.[3]

3 Words to Describe You: Spicy, smart and loving
Pet Peeves: When someone has a big ole Snuffleupagus sneeze and doesn't cover their nose. Oh my! And mean people.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Living my life as I believe I should; BEING the ME I like and respect. My teaching awards are pretty cool, too. Moms always feel like we need to say our kids are our proudest accomplishment – I think that goes without saying.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? Well, perhaps because I'm always in front of people in some sort of leadership role, everyone thinks I am super strong, have no problems…or never made a mistake. In reality, I am a bag of mistakes made and lessons learned. I am also tender-hearted—if someone else is hurt, I hurt. Basically, I'm a softy.
Who is your hero and why? Kious Kelly. Kious was the first nurse in New York to die of COVID-19. He gave his life for others. He was a dearly loved and respected nurse. He passed on March 24, 2020. Kious was my brother.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Ironically, a mix between Angelina and Tony. After Angelina's turbulent first few weeks, she slipped under the radar and made it to the end. Tony brought an upbeat, funny and light energy. By the time he was recognized as a threat, it was too late.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? My greatest asset is my emotional intelligence and ability to accurately read people. My game will be easy to argue at the final three. I believe being likable and smart/savvy pays off in the end and secures the vote.[3]

Pet Peeves: Arrogant people and those with a sense of entitlement
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? As a designer, my career has certainly taken hard hits during times of recession. In those times, I've never given up and have, at times, shifted gears to a new career path (i.e., I became a certified Pilates instructor following the 2008 recession). I am proud of every twist and turn I have adapted to and can confidently say I am a successful design leader today.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I know how to weld and build furniture out of metal. I worked in a metal shop for a year. I'm crafty and good with my hands.
Who is your hero and why? My husband is my hero. He left Australia to follow his dream to live in New York with two suitcases and enough money to last a few months. He's not afraid to try something different and take risks. He saved me from settling in life and inspires me to always strive for more!
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Kelley Wentworth's tenacity is definitely something I will emulate. I don't give up! Lauren Beck because she really studied and watched people to understand their motives. I love to study human behavior.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I have a high EQ (emotional intelligence). This means I know how to read people well and understand what they are feeling. I'm also a great listener and leader and know I will be able to gain trust.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Competent, charismatic, caring
Pet Peeves: People who have big dreams but don't work hard. People who are emotionally manipulative, or people who try to control me or tell me how to live my life.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Getting into every college I applied to because I worked hard for that, writing and directing my own show and having a successful community response, and enlisting in the Army National Guard. I was raised to prioritize things like service to my country and the world. I'm really proud of my decision to enlist.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I'm a karate black belt. Just kidding. It's jujitsu. Just kidding. Probably nothing. I am very open and honest. I don't want my insecurities to feed into other people's so I try to be as real as possible.
Who is your hero and why? Elon Musk. My life's mission is to change the world for the better. Building something like Tesla, which is uber successful and also a boon to the environment, is my dream.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? A cross between Victoria Baamonde and Chaos Kass. Victoria's blindside of Aubry is one of the most underappreciated moves ever, in my opinion, but she needed to take more control of her game, like Kass.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? Having grown up in the most competitive environment in America, I've gotten pretty good at persuading people to cheerfully act in my best interests and not theirs. Recommendation letters, winning elections, high attendance for all my events, etc. -- my entire life has been a highly successful exercise in persuasion. It sounds awful, but to some extent, I live every day the way Tony plays.[2]

Words to Describe You: Ebullient, driven
Pet Peeves: People who are so convinced they are right that they foreclose debate; people who are disruptive in movie theaters; when people try to talk to you even though you are wearing headphones; oatmeal raisin cookies masquerading as chocolate chip cookies.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I wrote in my journal a personal philosophy on what I think the purpose of life is, influenced by my battle with cancer, my religion and my ideological beliefs.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I collect signed pocket U.S. Constitutions. Among others, I have one signed by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, and the former U.S. ambassador to Estonia.
Who is your hero and why? George Washington, for being one of the few to ever resist power of that magnitude. Roddie Edmonds, for putting his life on the line to do what was right.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? In order for me to win, I will need to lower my threat level from the get-go. The most natural way is to embrace my inner goofy, like Fabio. And then, obviously the winners I would model my game after are Yul and Todd.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I truthfully think the odds are against me. It is all going to be a matter of threat management. I'm going to leave it all on the table. I will play my heart out because it will probably be the one shot I get – I've been waiting years, and I want no regrets. I can't promise you I will win, but I can promise you I will have fun and make the most of this opportunity. Cancer survivors don't go anything less than full throttle.[2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Staying true to myself no matter the circumstance. Also, riding Mickey's Fun Wheel at Disneyland despite being afraid of Ferris wheels.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I am terrified of vacuum cleaners. I can use one, but I can't be in a room when someone else is vacuuming because people always chase me with it, and it scares me.
Who is your hero and why? Kristin Wiig. She's so funny, adaptable, and paves the way for herself and writes.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I think Tom Westman. He was honest, but still a great player. Also, Cirie. She is a great social player. I'll carry my own in challenges but dominate socially. Maybe a little crazy like Debbie? Time will only tell.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I believe I could be the Sole Survivor because I'm likable, funny, but also wicked smart and strategic. I'm young, but still super capable of holding my own. I'm honest, but willing to make big moves that change the game. I'm ready![2]

3 Words to Describe You: Quirky, warm, self-aware
Pet Peeves: When people lack self-awareness, are emotionally reactive, immature, or petty
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I graduated 100% debt-free from my undergraduate degree and paid for 50% of my master's degree by competing in pageants and by earning academic scholarships.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I get this all the time: ""When I first met you, I thought you were going to be a mean girl, but now that I know you, that's not the case"". People tend to stereotype me, so they're surprised when they realize I have depth, am intelligent and that I do a lot of super nerdy things.
Who is your hero and why? It would be so cheesy to say ""Jesus"", but I did want to use this question to explain the importance of my faith. I am a fully devoted follower of Christ, and my life motto is to ""love God and love people"". I recognize that there is a higher calling on my life than simply living for myself.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? 100% Kim Spradlin. Not only was she a beast in challenges, but her social game was so strong. She developed genuine relationships with the other players, and almost everyone considered her a trustworthy ally, even if she didn't feel the same way about them. Her tribemates viewed her as a leader, and her alliance members followed her lead. She didn't go into the game trying to be super manipulative and deceptive. I felt like she tried to be as authentic as she could in a game like Survivor.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I am the total package. I am a strong social player because of my background in counseling and psychology, so I understand human behavior. I genuinely care about people and know how to connect on a deeper, personal level. I am an animal when it comes to anything physical because of my strength, grit, and unrelenting determination. I have studied the game of SURVIVOR, so I know what strategy will work in the game. I come off as a very sweet, trustworthy person, but people have no idea what I'm capable of. I know how to balance being a huge threat, while also drawing people in and making them want to work with me. My faith gives me an advantage because I can rely on God when I am weak and ask Him for guidance.[2]

Favorite Hobbies: Traveling to new cities and using their public transit system to explore, bringing my dogs to dog parks, recreating all my favorite dishes from scratch using recipes I find online.
3 Words to Describe You: Aggressive, astute, and audacious
Pet Peeves: I hate judgmental people. Looking down on someone for their lifestyle or choices because they're not the same choices you make is so stupid. I hate patronizing people who talk down to others. Oh, and I hate when people wear shoes in my house.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I'm the first person from my family to go to college and graduate. I bought my first home at 24. I paid off all my student loans ($40k) by age 26. I am the youngest associate director of analytics at my company, by age 27. Most importantly, I'm mentoring my younger brother to ensure he surpasses me in all aspects. Watching him make strides in school and in his personal life is my greatest accomplishment.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? People would never guess that I grew up in extreme poverty by looking at me now. My family and I have very comfortable lives today, but we've had to hustle and fight for the past two decades to improve our socio-economic class. We started in a one-bedroom apartment, shared with another family. My parents both worked seven days a week to provide for us, so I was often left alone to fend for myself from the age of 8. I learned to survive and be resilient from a very young age. People don't see that now, but I'll always cherish those tougher years. They made me strong.
Who is your hero and why? My mother is my hero. Cliché answer, but it's true. She came to the U.S. with my father and me as a 23-year-old refugee with no grasp of the English language and $40 in her pockets. I could only imagine how much courage that takes. She worked hard, took no breaks and was able to provide for me despite all the challenges she faced.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I want to say Parvati, but I'm not that hot nor charming. I will realistically be similar to Aubry. She was just a strategic mastermind. She understood social rankings and was able to strategize across very nuanced alliances. She's also non-threating, similar to myself, so I'll focus on keeping bigger physical and social threats around to ensure myself a shield. She was also not afraid to cross-alliance lines and work with people who could further her game. Don't rule anyone out.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I believe that I am a well-rounded individual with great logical sense, a strong ability to read social situations, amazing speaking abilities, and a strong desire to better my family's lives. There is no alternative besides coming home with a million-dollar check.[2]

Pet Peeve: Dishonest people
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Becoming an All-American Track Runner. If you are or ever have been a competitive athlete, you know the dedication, sacrifice, sweat and tears it takes to succeed. Every time I question my ability to make something happen, I look back at the girl who ran track and remember I was, and still am, that person!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I have a fear of death. I come off as super confident and strong, which I am, but deep down, I do fear the end. I think it stems from losing some very important people in my life at a young age. However, this fear doesn't cripple me; it gives me the perspective to live every day to the fullest.
Who is your hero and why? My mom! As I get older, I understand how much she gave up in having me and my older sister before the age of 18. I never wanted for anything and that is because my mom worked multiple jobs to ensure that never happened. When my Pops died and left her with 5 kids, she kept going and got me into university with a full scholarship. She is the bomb dot com.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Kelley Wentworth. She contributes to her team and sets up alliances while still being a competitor in the competitions.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I believe my personality, physical strength and ability to manipulate people to do what I want will help me get to the final. I am able to see where different personalities fit in my life and utilize them when it fits.[3]

Hometown: Kitchener, Ontario

Occupation: Veterinarian
Favorite Hobbies: Training animals, Settlers of Catan, and watching TV
3 Words to Describe You: Silly, empathetic and shameless
Pet Peeves: People who complain about the cost of vet care, rudeness, feeding seeds to parrots, gym grunters, Joey from ""Friends"", the fact that mini wheats have gelatin, when people talk bad about pigeons, and institutional racism.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I'm most proud of setting my mind to become an exotic animal specialist from undergrad. It is more difficult to get into vet school than med school in Canada, and the avian/exotics residency has the lowest admission rate of any specialty (3-5%). I'm also proud of maintaining my Muslim values while living in the Western world – abstaining from alcohol, pork and premarital sex – no matter how hard it may be. I am also proud of the resilience I didn't know I had within me to deal with my father's death in 2017.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? People would never know the difficult childhood I had financially and emotionally. We had very little money, living off my mom's disability support; there were times where our lights were cut, we were evicted, and there was little money for food. Given that level of instability, people would be surprised to realize how far I've been able to come. I still love both my parents very much, but I can also recognize their shortcomings. Their love for us was never a question to me, but I can reconcile that they are imperfect people who did the best they could, even though they fell short in some important ways. Also, I'm afraid of condiments.
Who is your hero and why? Although my father had many shortcomings, he's definitely someone I consider a hero. He had a tremendous amount of love for his children and even through some of his poor choices, that always shined through. He is missed every single day. I also admire my older sister very much because she often acted as a parent towards my younger sister and I but had no one to look up to herself. She's always been there for us emotionally, financially, or with whatever we need. She has risen to be a top emergency psychiatrist in Toronto, and that work with mental health is so important.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Rob Cesternino's strategic prowess – he really understood the power dynamics and when to shift the game, and also made people feel comfortable with humor. He was also able to articulate his game beautifully in confessional. Cirie Fields – her sit, wait, and strike strategy is savage. Tyson Apostol – his sass and strategic game. Kim Spradlin – her social skills were top notch, and she made an alliance with everyone, and wasn't afraid to make moves. Natalie Anderson for her laser focus.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? ""They must adapt, or they'll be voted out of the game"". A statement that has not changed. You can look to nature and Darwin's theory of evolution and see how the fittest survive, but the fittest may not be the lion in every situation. My ability to adapt, connect with others, understanding strategy & how to manipulate numbers, and most importantly – social awareness of myself and others are the key ingredients to success. I am not going to leave everything to starve on an island to let someone else win. I am playing for me and my family, and no one will get in the way of that. I can't wait to do the show I love so much proud, by not only winning but being the first Indian and Muslim to do so. It would be a dream come true to see my nieces watch me win and serve as a role model – that will never leave my mind.[2]

Occupation: Dietitian
Favorite Hobbies: Co-ed flag football in the sand at Bar A by the shore. Interior decorating for the holidays. Any high intensity or adrenaline activity – snowboarding, paintballing, skydiving, wake surfing, etc.
3 Words to Describe You: Loud! Growing up, my friends' parents always described me as ""the loud friend."" Talkative – all of my report cards every year [said] ""talkative"" or ""distracts others."" Intense personality – I'm a good person, but I definitely do not mesh with everyone.
Pet Peeves: I hate wasted time. Anything that just eats away time drives me nuts. I have too much pent-up energy that I need to do something. I hate slow and quiet talkers. Spit it out and speak up! This is why New Jersey is my homeland and the only place people understand me. We are all cut from the same cloth.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Becoming a dietitian and starting my own business. I never thought I would be in this position and be taking on this role. I surprised myself with what I am capable of, and I have more motivation than ever. I clearly can do much more than I thought, and now I want to see how far I can push myself. I run my own business, I conducted my first real interview and just hired a woman who could be my mom. I am literally now a BOSS! I gathered an accountant, payroll team, billing company, logo person, etc. My family is just as shocked as I am with what I managed to accomplish in such a short time frame. And we have been so successful! We have tripled our revenue in our second year and have been recognized nationally. My entire personality screams Survivor. Now with this momentum under my belt, nothing is going to stop me. Watch out tribe!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I played tackle football. It was difficult being on a team where nobody wanted me there, including my coaches. My teammates would literally hit me harder than everyone else because I was a girl. I'm not going to lie, it hurt a lot. But that wasn't going to stop me from playing and hitting harder back.
Who is your hero and why? I would have to say my younger sister. She graduated college to work in environmental law. She is super passionate about saving the environment and making the world safer for people. She is going to do great things. She is incredibly charming. She has this way about her that everyone immediately loves her. But she is also a very strong person. Not physically, but mentally. She does not back down from anyone or get intimidated. Even though she is my younger sister, I really look up to her. She has such great morals and is truly so caring and compassionate for others and always puts others first. She is awesome! She is just as big of a goofball as me.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Lauren Beck. She is very self-aware, and I feel like she does a great job of assessing everyone else's strengths and weaknesses, which helps her have a very good handle on the social game and how to outwit the best out of everyone. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how physically good you are at things. The social game dictates if you get voted out. This quality is the most important in my eyes.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I can definitely outwit everyone since I am very familiar with dealing with different types of people and have always had a strategic mind. I can read people very well and am very good at persuading others. Plus, let's be real, people are stupid. And when people are hungry, they forget how to stay composed. Once you see the cracks, it gets easier to outwit. I can outplay everyone because I am very competitive and athletic so I should be one of the top competitors in challenges. I'm an animal. I can outlast everyone because I have grit. I have always been able to endure difficult and uncomfortable situations when needed if I know there is a bigger outcome on the other side waiting for me. I don't break easily. I have too much determination to ever think to quit. I will be the final Survivor![2]

Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I don't think anyone has played a game like the one I will play. But I do want to achieve great Survivor historical moments like Sandra, Cirie, Parvati, Rupert, Rob. I want to be remembered.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I know I can be the final Survivor because I am likable enough and persuasive enough to convince people to vote for me. I always find a way to get what I want.[1]

Age: 58
Hometown: Hoboken, NJ
Current Residence: Hoboken, NJ
Occupation: Retired Firefighter
Favorite Hobbies: Working out, sports, and watching great movies
3 Words to Describe You: Loyal, loud and fair
Pet Peeves: People ripping open cereal boxes and leaving them open. People who are late.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Easy! Raising my children! I know it's cliché, but it's true. I come from the projects, not a very good home life, and I didn't know how to be a father. But I watched other good fathers, learned and raised two amazing kids and I'm very proud.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I'm sensitive. I care. I get my feelings hurt. I'm smart (at least I think so). My heart hurts for the less fortunate. I love learning. I'm a straight arrow.
Who is your hero and why? Not sure if I have any heroes, but I have people I looked up to and who taught me about life, how to be a father, a hard worker, honest, and loyal: Capt. Stankiswiez, John O'Brien, Aunt Ruth and Uncle David.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would love to play like Boston Rob. Not sure it will work out that way but I really believe that I have all the great attributes of all the great players.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I honestly think I can be the final Survivor because I possess all the attributes needed. I'll be a beast in challenges, a worker in camp, yet I'll make people believe I'm not a threat until it's too late. I also have the gift of gab! People will like me (even Jeff).[3]

3 Words to Describe You: Energetic, empathetic, and chaotic
Pet Peeves: When people don't listen to me, people who walk slowly in front of me, anything that disrupts my sleep, hypocrites, and people who don't apologize.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Writing an article for my school newspaper that led to me being invited to consult with my university's Equity and Inclusion officer on creating a better framework and support for Black students at McMaster University. Being able to use my voice for change that not only benefitted me was so empowering.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I am a great listener! Just because I talk a lot, it does not mean I am not listening. People are so used to hearing me when I am there, so when I am quiet, people usually don't think I'm there and I can take notice on what they are saying. Also, I check in on people and let them vent to me, which gives me more context about them that can help guide my future decisions.
Who is your hero and why? My hero is my mother. She was born into poverty in a village in Kenya as the youngest of five. My mother is so hardworking and managed to get herself out of poverty and became a doctor in Kenya and was able to provide for her mom. She then gave that all up to support my father's dreams, but then became a doctor in Canada while having three young children while dealing with the systemic racism in academic medicine. My mom sacrificed and worked so hard to give her family a better life and never faltered from her dreams. I aspire to be like her. She changed my life.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Davie. Davie was someone who had loyalty to many people, had a strong core alliance and was social. Not only that but he was able to find idols and win challenges and play idols correctly to further his game. But most of all, Davie had so much fun when he was on the island, no matter if he was on the top or bottom of his tribe. Davie had the path to 6th place, and I will perfect it to 1st.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I believe I will win Survivor because I am a social person, and Survivor at its core is a numbers game. I have lived in diverse cities and also been in situations where I was the only black person. But in every situation, I thrived and Survivor is another place where my resilience and personality will shine. Also, I never go down without a fight. When all hope is lost, I will be searching for idols, talking to people, and convincing them that me staying is best for everyone. I am going on Survivor to win and I will do everything in my power to do so.[2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I'm proud of the life I'm building with my fiancé. I'm proud of being a teacher. I'm proud of making it through college. Opening my selfie museum.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? That I am terrified of clowns!
Who is your hero and why? I'm my own hero. I save myself each and every time. But my mom is the ultimate hero, because now that I'm all grown up and she's no longer here, I realize how much she truly persevered.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? James: ""Don't bite the apple!"" Stay true to your alliance as best you can, and stick it out to the end.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? There isn't anything in the world that I cannot accomplish. My mindset has gotten me to the finish line of all my dreams. Plus, I'm super lovable and not an immediate threat.[3]

3 Words to Describe You: Self-sufficient, resourceful, witty
Pet Peeve(s): When people walk slowly right in front of you, when you open the door for someone and they don't say thank you, when people are passive aggressive.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? My parents let me borrow their 20-year-old Lexus SUV a few years back, and I immediately ran the passenger side door into a 4' tall concrete pole by making a sharp right turn and not seeing it in my blind spot. To fix the destroyed door would have cost more money than the car was worth, so I looked at websites of a few junkyards, found [one] that had a 2000 gold Lexus LX470, bargained it down from $750 to $400, and installed the new door on Thanksgiving day. Aside from the passenger window now being tinted, it was like the accident never happened!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I think a lot of people think I'm an un-athletic girly girl, but my dad raised me to be the son he never had. I grew up racing dirtbikes and going to fishing derbies. And at my high school's traditional junior vs. senior girls powderpuff football game, I put a girl in a headlock and tackled her to the ground. (There's photo evidence.)
Who is your hero and why? Easy – my dad. He's the reason I'm athletic, resourceful, and driven. He decided to be the parent to me and my sister that he never had. He's the best—so supportive, and he never lets a day go by without telling us he loves us. He's the reason I'm in tech sales; I always wanted to be just like him when I grew up.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Either Kelley Wentworth or Joe Anglim. Joe was obviously an insane competitor at the individual challenges, but he also proved himself to be a necessary part of the tribe with how resourceful he was. Both were generally likable people to their tribes. It's necessary to perform things like blindsides in order to keep yourself in the game, but I think Kelley and Joe both played in a lawful-enough way that wasn't anywhere near as manipulative as other people like Sandra or Tony.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? In sales I have to outwit people every day. It helps having a high EQ, and I've always been way more emotionally intelligent than book smart. That's a huge attribute when interacting with other tribe members. Having a Psychology degree and being in sales gives me great people skills; put me in a room of strangers and we'll leave as friends. I'm good at connecting with people and making them feel comfortable enough to trust me, which is key in a game like SURVIVOR. I'm a strong competitor. Don't judge me by my size! I will never give up on something that I want; I'm that stubborn and I do not like losing.[3]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? My family! My husband and I have made it through some rough times and have three amazing children.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? How tough, resilient and determined I can be.
Who is your hero and why? My dad. He has accomplished so much. He overcame so many obstacles from childhood through his adult years and not only thrived, but brought so many others along with him, to ensure he ended the cycle of poverty that would've plagued the extended family otherwise.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Cirie, because I love to connect and do so easily. I will play hard without seeming to on the surface.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I believe that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. I can influence others to make decisions, and they'll think it was their idea the whole time. I am resilient, too; it is not about how many times I fall, but that I get up one more time. I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing well, so I give 100% always.[2]

Pet Peeve(s): People that cut in line. Smacking gum. When people play games on their phone and don't put the phone on silent.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I've never strayed from my goals, even when people tell me my expectations are too high. The common assumption is that you can have it all, just not all at once. I'm here to show you that you can! I look around at this life that I've very intentionally created for myself and our family and think, ""What if I had listened to everyone and just stopped dreaming? I wouldn't have any of this!""
What is something we would never know from looking at you? People are mostly surprised at how competitive I am, especially as I get older. It's as if people think I should have outgrown that phase in my life by now. I come across as non-threatening, and it is very intentional on my part – this is going to help me in the game.
Who is your hero and why? Healthcare providers! Specifically my co-workers and nursing school best friends, who I relied on for strength and support while I cared for Covid patients during the pandemic.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Natalie – mental and physical strength. Sarah – strategic. Michele – social.

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Being that English is my second language, I grew up in the hood and was homeless for a period of time, the accomplishment that I am most proud of is graduating with my Associates degree with a 4.0 GPA.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I grew up shy, quiet and in my head, which made me a thinker and very analytical. People also don't see that if they mess or compete with me, they will lose. A whole new alter ego comes out that turns into a beast during any competition.
Who is your hero and why? My husband is my hero because he is everything I have. He motivates me and has encouraged me through so much. He is also in the military, so he is a real hero in life!
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? It would have to be a combination of Cochran and Boston Rob. I am not as physical as Rob, but I will be strategic like Cochran. I'm hoping that by the end of the season, people will see that I played my own game.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? Because in life, I am already a survivor. In life I did not have the luxury to mess up and have people help me. In life I struggled and fought hard for everything I've accomplished. I have the fire in me and the willpower to show the world that I deserve to win and will not let anything or anyone get in my way.

3 Words to Describe You: Clever, perceptive and authentic
Pet Peeve(s): Really the only way someone can earn a spot on my bad side is by being inconsiderate or intentionally hurtful to others. Social injustice and discrimination make my blood boil. I will always speak up when I observe it, even if it gets me into trouble.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I am most proud of persistence in education, despite challenges. When it came time to apply for college, my high school advisor told me I would be wasting time and money if I enrolled, but I had a deep desire to study psychology so that I could work towards helping families like mine that were impacted by addiction. I was accepted to a program for students with lower GPAs and/or standardized test scores, with the contingency that I had to make A's in all of my first semester classes. After meeting this requirement, I realized how good it felt to do well in school, show up to class and try hard at things that were challenging. I graduated college early, with a 3.89 GPA and proceeded to earn a 4.0 GPA in all of my Master's and Doctoral courses.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? Most people don't know that I'm creative and artsy. I love to write, paint, and learn new crafts when I have time for it!
Who is your hero and why? My Abuelos, my maternal grandparents, are my greatest heroes because of their ability to persevere through adversity and take risks to better the lives of their family and communities.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I think I have the natural ability to lead a group to the end in the same way Kim Spradlin did, but I also realize she had a lot of luck and circumstance on her side during her first season. Kelley Wentworth is an example of how I will play if I find myself without such luck. I am scrappy and crafty and would be fighting up until the last minute to find idols and sway votes in the same way. I can also see myself playing a social and strategic game like Cirie Fields. People see me as caring and nurturing, so I will be afforded more room to subtly manipulate and push for my best interest, without turning people against me. I'd also feel proud to play and grow in the same way that Sarah Lacina did across her seasons.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I will outwit by use of my natural social skill and cutthroat strategy. People will trust, share information, and be disarmed by me, which will make me dangerous. I am coming into the game with the understanding that SURVIVOR is a world with a different set of social norms, so my mindset will shift away from Psychologist ethics and toward SURVIVOR Ethics. I will outplay with my natural competitiveness, athleticism, and tenacity. I will not give up. In this new era, advantages are key, so I will hustle hard to find and use advantages to keep myself alive! And I will outlast by moving towards small goals that will motivate me along the way. I will know when to strike and when to lay low. I will be sneaky when I have to be and transparent when it is beneficial. I will adapt with the game.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Ambitious, confident and strong-willed.
Pet Peeve(s): Someone making a reference to ""The Office"" within two seconds of learning my name. Arrogance. Refusal to use turn signals while driving.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? In my sophomore year of high school, I decided to take the ACT, just to see how I would do on it, and I ended up getting a perfect score. That was great for college admissions, and it garnered me attention locally and nationally. Due to that, I've had parents in Memphis tell me that they've used me as an example for their kids, to show what black people can accomplish academically. It's not the actual score that I'm proud of; it's the idea that, hopefully, someone felt motivated by seeing black representation in an academic space.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? That I had a whole career as a journalist that rivals that of professionals, all before I entered college! I got into journalism because as a kid, I wanted to become President and decided that the best way to learn was by interviewing other political figures. The list of people I've interviewed includes Cory Booker, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. I also covered the red carpet at the National Civil Rights Museum's Freedom Awards for many years, interviewing honorees.
Who is your hero and why? My parents! My dad was raised in a small town in Mississippi and is now a doctor with his own practice in Memphis, and my mom is a registered nurse [turned] stay-at-home mom. They've been able to do so much with their lives despite obstacles, thus being able to provide me with so much in my life.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I hope to emulate Wendell's game from ""Ghost Island"" the most. He made it far due to an extremely strong social game, and I hope to create that same level of bond, such that people will want to keep me around, even if doing so would be detrimental to their long-term game. Also, he performed well in challenges, both in the individual and tribal phases when needed.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I can be the Sole Survivor not just because of my social skills or intellect, but because of the passion that I put into every single thing that I do in life. If I set my mind to do something, I'm giving it everything until I see that goal met. I'm well aware that I lack typical skills for living outdoors, but many legends of the game lacked those skills initially as well. I've always been open to learning and adapting to my environment in order to succeed, and I don't plan on treating this game any differently, especially in the succeeding part.[1]

3 Words to Describe You: Green (both in that I absorb all new experiences/information around me, and am environmentally conscious), empathetic, witty
Pet Peeve(s): Being ""mansplained"" to, people on their phones while you're hanging out.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? The body of work that I am most proud of is my senior thesis, which bridged my two majors of Environmental Science and Visual Arts. They are two departments that have never worked together as a double major, and it took a lot of initiative to create my own syllabus and thesis which addresses both. The thesis is a true reflection of me, of my equal passions in sustainability and art.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? People often assume I'm extroverted because I've very effusive and engaged, especially when meeting someone for the first time. But I'm definitely an introvert and need time alone to recharge.
Who is your hero and why? My father paved the way for my family and our life as we know it. He grew up as a sweet potato farmer in the impoverished countryside of China; he eventually came to the United States, completed his PhD in genetics, and now creates biotechnologies to increase yields for those very crops. To say I admire his tenacity, discipline, and work ethic is an understatement.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Kim Spradlin. She had the ability to control the game based on her interpersonal relationships, convincing everyone on the tribe that they could trust her. She straddled the perfect balance of executing huge game moves without being pegged as the mastermind—and is feminism at its finest. Also, Andrea Boehlke because she is outdoorsy, carried her weight and manipulated people while staying likable.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? Given the evolution of the game, I see the winner as having to sit between multiple trust clusters and have the intuition to know when to rely on which at any given moment. I can sit in that position; I can create relationships with people from completely different backgrounds and juggle the nuances of my different alliances. My athleticism and outdoor experience give me the ability to ""outlast,"" but I see my real strong-suit in the ""outwit"" portion. I can read social dynamics easily, which will allow me to be ahead of the curve in terms of moves. I'll make my own moves, so that at Final Tribal Council, there will be no question of whether or not I played actively and assertively.[2]

What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Winning the United States Chess Open (largest chess tournament in the USA) for my rating bracket when I was 12. You are playing against grown people, and I won $1,200. That was like $100,000 to me at the time! It gave me the confidence that I could do almost anything.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I grew up in the church. I was an usher and sang in the choir from age 6 to 17. My dad was a deacon and my mom was a deaconess. I have a deep faith but it is my own faith. I don't talk about it a lot but I am a big believer.
Who is your hero and why? My mom. She overcame a lot to raise me and give me the foundation to be the person that I am today. She made sure I was raised in a safe house, made sure I went to church to develop a moral compass, took me to black history workshops as a child so I had a sense of self worth. She made sure I got into the best public school in the city, then made sure I could travel the country as a middle schooler playing chess. She passed away five years ago, and as I grow older, I grow to admire her more each day.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Sandra's ""anyone but me"" will always be my strategy, as long as I see a path to the end and I am with people, or have people, in which I trust. If I don't have that, I will be an agent of chaos Russell with charm. I am playing to win and not for 7th place.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I thrive, and find a certain comfort, in chaos. Managing events at a club on a Friday night anything can happen, but whatever issues pop up you have to handle. That takes interpersonal skills if it is dealing with people, and it takes general problem-solving skills when dealing with a venue, and you still have to make sure everyone at your party has a great time.[2]

What is something we would never know from looking at you? Something people don't think when they see me is that I am a tremendous athlete. What a lot of people see when they look at me is my prosthetic, and they feel sorry for me and doubt my capabilities. And that is their first mistake.
Who is your hero and why? My mom. She is my best friend, my motivation and everything I aspire to be. She is the most selfless and caring person I know, and I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for her.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would like to play a similar game as Kelley Wentworth on her second season. Her tribe mates didn't think she was a big threat, but she found Hidden Immunity Idols and created blindsides to further herself in the game.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I have the ability to form friendships easily, and I will use that to my advantage to go far in the game.

What is something we would never know from looking at you? My background is very culturally diverse with my father being an immigrant from Morocco.
Who is your hero and why? My grandpa, Dale Donald Mann, because he is the hardest working man I have ever known, and he always made sure I knew what was most important: family. He was an amazing husband to my grandmother; seeing him build their relationship upon love and trust taught me so much about how to love somebody. And he understood me more than anybody else ever has. When I would tell him about my insecurities and self-doubt, he would help me understand how those things are actually strengths. I knew I could always count on my grandpa, and I want to make him smile from up there.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Kelley Wentworth. What I admire and take away from Wentworth's game is that she never gave up until her torch was snuffed, and even when she was clearly in the bottom, she not only found ways to climb up, but she made everybody think that she was oblivious and not smart enough to foil the foolproof plan they had.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? Because I do not allow myself to not know what is going on with those around me. I am too conversationally and emotionally experienced with people to be unaware of my standing in the game at all times, and I am too determined and hungry to get comfortable. Everybody that I meet grows a heart on their sleeve after I speak with them for 20 minutes, and my competitors on the island will be no different.[2]

Favorite Hobbies: Going out with friends, traveling and being outdoors
3 Words to Describe You: Optimistic, charismatic, fearless
Pet Peeve(s): Lazy people, social media addicts, clipping nails in a public location
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I'm really proud of the relationship[s] I have with my family and friends. Without them, life would be boring. Knowing they are there for me, no matter what, is comforting.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? [Several] of my bottom front teeth are fake. When I was a kid, my older brother strapped me into a sled behind an ATV in a frozen cornfield, and the sled flipped over.
Who is your hero and why? Devon Yaddof, a best friend of mine who passed from cancer in high school. His loss lit a fire in me at a very young age. That fire continues to drive me to live my life differently. And my parents, as I'm grateful for them selflessly molding me into the man I am today.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Malcolm – he was a likable, physically skilled, humble player who used that skill set to advance his way through the game. Malcolm and I share multiple character, personality and physical skill sets. The ability to sit back and sometimes play the role of a fool to fool the fool who thinks they're fooling you is critical in competing in this game.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I know that SURVIVOR and I were meant for each other. Just took us 20 years to realize it! My charismatic, fun-loving personality will enable me to build alliances. My competitive edge will keep numbers through winning challenges. Experience being outdoors will help in building shelter and sourcing food. My experiences, profession, and living in different cities have given me wisdom ahead of my time, and I will use that to my advantage in communicating with players older than me, while my active lifestyle and youthful spirit will enable me to relate to younger players.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Ambitious, gregarious, adaptable
Pet Peeve(s): Tardiness, pessimism, slow drivers
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? My parents are Mexican immigrants who became teenage parents at the age of 16, which led me to grow up in a low-income community where college was only a dream. Fortunately, school became a safe space for me, where I felt loved, cared for and seen. I recognized that through school, I could follow my passions and most importantly, get out of the hood. I'm proud to say I'm the first in my family to graduate from high school, and the first to graduate from college, and I did it all with a full-ride scholarship from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Millennium Scholars program. This queer Chicana did that!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I'm incredibly competitive and an overachiever in every aspect of my life.
Who is your hero and why? My grandfather, Elizafat Godoy. He immigrated to the U.S. from Chilpancingo, Guerrero, Mexico to provide a better life for his family, and he instilled strong educational values in me. He loves his family and my grandmother unconditionally. He's the most important male figure in my life.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Cirie Fields because she was an incredibly well-rounded, social, and analytical player. She was loved by all, she knew when to stir the pot, and she knew how to keep a strong social game that could take her to the end. I'm physically strong, so I'll use that as an added advantage.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I'm adaptable, resilient, gregarious, and my ancestors have my back. I'm confident in my social game, that I'll build relationships across differences and get along with just about anyone. With my wife and family in my heart and thoughts, I know I will make it to the end.[2]

Favorite Hobbies: Playing chess with my son. Dancing with my daughter. Binge-watching shows with my wife after the chess player and dancer fall asleep.
3 Words to Describe You: Aware, ambitious, unbreakable
Pet Peeve(s): Quitters, people who complain about things but aren't willing to change, and personalized license plates.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? The family I've built with my wife. Every day I get to watch my kids actually be kids and grow at their own pace. That's something that I never had and always wanted. It doesn't matter what else I've done or end up doing; building a family with my wife takes the cake.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I do research at Duke. You don't look at me and see a scholar. As Biggie says though, ""I'm sicker than your average.""
Who is your hero and why? My wife. She's been with me every step of the way and had to make the same sacrifices as me to get here. She juggles the weight of both kids, my stresses, as well as her own, and still manages to maintain her composure. She's got no fear and has always pushed me to do better. I could go on forever, but at the end of the day I just want to make her proud.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I'm basically Spencer or Christian (David vs. Goliath) if they got jumped into a gang at 15. I'm definitely bringing an academic mindset to the game because I've spent more hours thinking about how people vote than Sandra and Boston Rob combined. At the same time, I wasn't raised in an ivory tower and have been around the block enough to know there is stuff textbooks can't teach you about real people and life.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I've researched voting behavior for years. I don't care if I'm out there with someone who never missed an episode of SURVIVOR, or someone who played 3 times already, they ain't gonna hold a candle to me strategically. But I'm also not an academic by nature and have gone from being a gang member to dealing with Harvard-level researchers on a daily basis—so I can adapt to any environment and build relationships with anyone.[3]

Favorite Hobbies: Backpacking, hiking, video games, taking and coaching fitness classes
3 Words to Describe You: Loyal, charismatic, passionate
Pet Peeve(s): People who are entitled. And people who don't know what to do at a four-way stop.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Being named an admission director at my age is rare. To be named director at my alma mater reminds me that the grind has been worth it, and that people have noticed how dedicated and genuinely invested I am.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? That I'm a great public speaker and use my people skills at work every day. Asian men have certain unfair stereotypes associated with them, and I do not fit that mold. I played football in high school, was rush chair for my fraternity, and can entertain a room of 800 people. I use my EQ more than my IQ on an average day.
Who is your hero and why? My parents. They are kind, fun, hard-working and dedicated to one another. They're more active and social than I am! They gave me a life that anyone would dream of when they adopted me as a baby, and they have supported me in every endeavor I have taken on. I owe them everything and want to make them proud.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I would love to play a similar game to Adam Klein. He kept his threat level low, had good relationships with everyone, and was his authentic, superfan self.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I can win SURVIVOR because I am an unassuming triple threat. Socially, I'm likable and take a genuine interest in people. I make people feel like I am invested in them because I actually am! Physically, I am athletic enough to be an asset early in the game; however, nobody is going to mistake me for Ozzy and view me as a threat to go on an individual immunity run. Strategically, I am a SURVIVOR super-duper fan and have seen every season and watch the international versions. I have studied this game and know what works and what doesn't. Most importantly, I am pretty self-aware and know that I need to play my own game and go with the flow as the game develops.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Groovy, charismatic, and creative.
Pet Peeve(s): Narrow-minded, judgmental people. Also, people who have no reverence for Mother Nature and all her beautiful beings!
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I've fought through many painful experiences and never let it break me or hold me back for long. I have a fighting spirit and will always be proud of my perseverance. But I am also very proud of showing my designs in a fashion show!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I've always carried a deep spiritual wonder and appreciation for life, nature and all of its many beautiful complexities. I can manifest and create anything when I surrender fully to the moment and find acceptance in it. Maintaining that flow throughout the game will not always be easy, but it is a top priority.
Who is your hero and why? I know it sounds cliché but my mom is freaking incredible! She has faced so much adversity and never allowed it to break her spirit. She is a legend in my eyes and the ultimate ""survivor"" to ""thriver.""
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I've always admired Kim Spradlin's game, she was a low-key assassin! I loved seeing a good triple-threat win; she played a very strong social, strategic and physical game. She ""puppeted"" her alliance through the entire game while keeping the target off her back.
Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor? I think I've got the sweet spot in all the right places. I'm physically fit and competitive, I will be an asset to my tribe but my slighter stature will make me appear non-threatening. I am intuitive and an out-of-the-box thinker. My clever and witty nature will allow me to maneuver and adapt throughout the unexpected twists in the game. I have the ability to manipulate and persuade others, and while I don't abuse that in my everyday life, all bets are off in SURVIVOR. My life experiences, optimistic charm, and open-minded outlook will allow me to connect deeply with others, disarm them and form strong alliances and friendships. But I can use my logic to stay detached enough to always make the best decision for my game. When the rubber meets the road, I'll do whatever it takes to play in a powerful way. People won't see me coming and that's exactly what I'm counting on.[2]

What is something we would never know from looking at you? As social as I am, I enjoy time alone. I am also more sensitive than most think.
Who is your hero and why? My father. He's always there for us. He was also a Green Beret and is a patriot.
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? If I can only pick one, then I'd say Sandra. She was always in the right place at the right time. She had phenomenal strategies and game play.

Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? I get a kick out of doing things that scare me, or that feel impossible, or that I dreamed of doing as a kid. SURVIVOR checks all of those boxes.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I am one of five sisters, and I'm the classic middle child – social, independent, problem–solving. To survive the Pomilla sisters, you gotta be dynamic, and keep up!
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Strategically, probably Cirie or Omar. Swag-wise, probably Malcolm.
What will you value in an alliance partner? Someone practical, open-minded, not self-serious, and must be fun!

Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? I've been watching SURVIVOR for over a decade and have never ceased to be impressed by how a game built on deception and testing relationships has brought up conversation around society's most pressing issues and how we all get along with each other. It's the ultimate game and the ultimate challenge I can put myself through.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Growing up and in college, I was a part of a number of different communities and learned to adapt to the norms of each of them – often context switching between very different groups, such as my predominantly Chinese dance group and my American high school.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify with: Erika (Season 41) because we're both small Asian women who can be underestimated. Play like: Mix of Tina (Season 2) because she was well-liked and underestimated because of it, and Sophie Clarke (South Pacific) for her strategic prowess.

Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I'll be underestimated from the get-go and can adapt my game to the dynamics at play at the time. I think I can pull the strings without anyone realizing it's me. By the time they do, it'll be too late![2]

What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Growing up as a queer black Jewish woman, I have always been the odd one out. I feel like I've been playing a social/strategic game of SURVIVOR my whole life to fit in, succeed, and reach my goals.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify most with Michele Fitzgerald. I love her social game and how she used people's perceptions of her against them. I think I'll play most like Natalie Anderson in Blood Vs.

Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify most with Natalie. She is competitive, direct, and pretty loyal; however, she was willing to make moves against her alliance when the timing was right.
What will you value in an alliance partner? I value someone logical, with a strategic mind. Duos can be so powerful if they remain loyal, so I'd also want to find someone who I don't think will flip on me first.

What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? My mom worked for the YMCA when I was younger…so I was always outside, in a forest, climbing trees, swimming in lakes and rivers, surrounded by friends and nature. My unique childhood taught me to love the outdoors and people.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I think I identify with Elaine the most because she was hilarious yet genuine. I would like to think that I will play most like Shan or Ben. Everyone came to Shan and felt comfortable telling her info. Ben was someone who had his baggage and learned how to overcome it and help others along the way.
What will you value in an alliance partner? Trust, trust, trust! You have to be able to trust someone in this game. But you also want someone who has different talents than yourself, so what you offer each other fills the other's weak spots.
Favorite Hobbies: Adventures with my son and husband, rollercoasters, waterslides, eating food from all over the world, growing and collecting plants
Pet Peeves: People that talk in circles, people who don't give others time to talk in a convo, the color combo of purple and white, misformed popsicles, odd numbers, pineapple on pizza, malt chocolate candy

Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? I want to be a part of SURVIVOR to prove to myself, and any other little gay Black boy or girl that you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to. Growing up with a medical condition, I was always told by numerous people and doctors that I couldn't or wouldn't be able to do things like other people. I called bull crap and have completely astounded doctors with what I have achieved both professionally and personally. Never let anyone tell you that you can't do something.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I feel as if your life experiences will help get you further in the game. As a physician, I meet a variety of new people on a daily basis. This will help my social game as I must get that individual to trust my diagnosis, explanation, and treatment plan in 20 minutes during an office visit.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify most with Jeremy. I will play most like Davie. He had a great social game and was a beast at challenges.
What will you value in an alliance partner? I will value an alliance partner's complete honesty and trustworthiness. Without these two characteristics, do you truly have an alliance?
Favorite Hobbies: Obstacle course races, traveling, tending to my houseplants
Pet Peeves: Those who mispronounce salmon. Unnecessary rudeness. People who walk slow in front of me.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Graduating at the top of my class after undergoing a total gastrectomy during my first year of medical school
What is something we would never know from looking at you? One would never know that I was born with a congenital deformity called Prune Belly Syndrome. This required me to have a kidney transplant at nine years old. I am on life-long immunosuppressant medication which inadvertently caused me to develop stomach cancer when I was 25. I had to have a complete stomach removal because of this and relearn how to eat. I'm doing great and am cancer-free.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? Besides my mom, who helped me find who I was in the world, I would say my deceased kidney donor, Kristen Reagle. She died at the age of 15 from a drunk driver and her grandma donated all of her organs. I was a near perfect match and received her kidney. I live every day for her and would not be here without her.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I will be the Sole Survivor because adversity and survival have been my life. I wasn't supposed to live past age five. I survived a kidney transplant. I beat cancer. I grew up a gay Black man in Ohio. I also know how to communicate with many different people to establish trust and alliances to further my game play. Lastly I am a very athletic individual which has only come from the hard work and dedication to being healthy due to my illness. This means I can take any negative situation and flip it into a positive endeavor. This is required to outlast all the trials and tribulations of the game.[3]

What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Honestly? Failing at stuff. Failing to get a job, into college, into SURVIVOR (the first time). In all those cases, I had to pick myself up and try again, and I think the best Survivors are defined by how they respond to setbacks.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I aspire to combine the listening and consensus-building strengths of Yul with some goofiness and youthful energy, a la Maryanne.
What will you value in an alliance partner? I think the days of riding coattails are over; everyone is too good at the game. So what I want is someone I genuinely connect with, who I can frankly and openly discuss ways to mutually benefit.
Favorite Hobbies: Taiko, music, running
Pet Peeves: People who interrupt other people
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Running a marathon. No other time in my life has so much time, sweat, and willpower coalesced into one awesome event. At least...not yet.
What is something we would never know from looking at you?  Not a fan of peanut butter.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? Both my parents have inspired and continue to inspire me. No matter what personal issue they had, they always prioritized my brother and I, which I'll always be grateful for.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I've got the 1-2 punch of a goofy grin and a strategic brain, with an ultra-competitive hot streak. I'll be the last one standing.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Easygoing, ambitious, confident
Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? I want to be part of SURVIVOR because it is a once in a lifetime adventure. SURVIVOR is the perfect combination of physical and mental strength. I want to challenge myself in an avenue that I really have no experience in. By no means am I a survivalist lol. I have never even been camping, so surviving in the elements will be an exciting challenge.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Making it into the NFL has prepared me for SURVIVOR. I had to overcome one obstacle after another to make a team. It taught me the importance of hard work and believing in yourself, even when the cards are stacked against you.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify with Danny the most. He knows what it is like to play in the NFL and carried a lot of those lessons into the game. I think that I will play the most like Jeremy because of his self-awareness. He knew that he would be a physical threat, so he kept other physically strong survivors around as meat shields.""
What will you value in an alliance partner? I will value someone who I can communicate well with. There really is no trust in the game of SURVIVOR so I want to align with someone who is predictable.
Favorite Hobbies: Coaching at Parisi Speed School, snowboarding, enjoying any lake, cooking, grilling
Pet Peeves: Gum smacking, people eating with their mouth open
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I am most proud of playing for the Seattle Seahawks.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? You would never know that I play the piano. I also do some pretty good magic tricks.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My parents are my biggest inspiration because they both became successful on their terms. They taught me to always go after what you want and never take no for an answer.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I will be the Sole Survivor because I am the perfect combination of physical and mental strength. I am able to fit into any crowd because I have been exposed to so many different backgrounds of people. I will not be denied.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Curious, calculating, zesty!
Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? SURVIVOR is like a four-course meal for the brain, body, and spirit! Where else can you untangle complex social webs, perform extreme physical feats, and learn your own limits (only to exceed them!)??
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I worked at an intense, high-traffic nail salon for five years, where I had to balance the needs of customers with those of 20 Vietnamese women, many twice my age and with ranging language barriers. I had to navigate very different perspectives to keep everyone happy, sometimes with grown adults literally screaming in my face about their nails.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? There are so many players I'd like to say here, but I identify most with Gabby and Aubry. I hope to play like those two strong women with that extra spunk that we saw from Maryanne.

Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I will be the Sole Survivor because I have two superpowers in this game: enthusiasm and adaptability. I am always learning and shifting based on my surroundings, and I'll weather any storm with a smile.[4]

3 Words to Describe You: Kind, passionate, determined
Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? SURVIVOR is the game that puts the human condition on display and strips you down to your rawest form. It's terrifying. I believe true happiness is found outside your comfort zone.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I feel if I was a little younger, I may have answered firefighting or mixed martial arts fights; however I don't believe that. I believe you can't really be prepared for this experience, which might make me more prepared.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Jeremy Collins, my man!! I hope I can be cunning in the affable way he is.
Favorite Hobbies: Brazilian jiu-jitsu, running with my dog, breath work, meditation

What is something we would never know from looking at you? Growing up, I was very insecure about my body, my voice and speech.

She and my brother-in-law adopted two children from Haiti and had one biological. Sadly, shortly after, my brother- in-law died of a rare cancer. My sister presses on, lives life to the fullest and even got her Ph.D. after his death.[2]

Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? I am a day one SURVIVOR fan! We grew up watching SURVIVOR as a family. Thanks to our VHS recorder, we never missed an episode! As a superfan, it is a lifelong dream to be the Sole Survivor. I have learned a lot from the show especially that ANYTHING is POSSIBLE.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? My time in corporate America prepared me for the show. I spent over a decade navigating different personalities and building winning teams. Relationship building is EVERYTHING!
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I relate to Angelina – she is bold & brilliant! I think I will play most like Erika. She played such a high-level game! Her social skills and strategic relationship-building was amazing!
What will you value in an alliance partner? I will value loyalty. I am looking for a ride or die partner!
Favorite Hobbies: Gardening, yoga, cooking, golfing, hiking, reading, painting, swimming, writing, eating, laughing, meditating, catching up on my shows.

3 Words to Describe You: Personable, resistant, adaptable
Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? SURVIVOR is not only the experience of a lifetime but an opportunity for self-growth and discovery. My boys and I are also fans of the game so this will be an opportunity to show my kids that they can do anything.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Becoming a single parent has prepared me most for the game. That in itself has challenged me physically, mentally, emotionally, and basically in every single way possible.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I want to be a quiet strategist. I think my gameplay will most likely resemble that of Erika (Season 41). But I also love the way Natalie played in Blood Vs. Water and Winners at War. Her strength and ability to never give up is most admirable.
What will you value in an alliance partner? I value openness and honesty. I'm looking for someone who is not only loyal in their words but their actions. In order to gain my trust, they'll have to show me that they can be trusted in votes or by sharing valuable information.
Favorite Hobbies: When I'm not attending my kids' sporting events or kicking their butts in Mario Kart, I enjoy reading and listening to podcasts and sermons online.
Pet Peeves: When people don't own up to their actions or mistakes
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Can it be growth? I am most proud of how much I have grown over the last several years. As an individual and in motherhood. I am very proud of the woman I am becoming.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I think at first glance, many wouldn't be able to tell that I am in my thirties and a mom of two.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My parents are my biggest inspiration. My mother is the most selfless and giving person I know while my father is such a hard worker.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I believe that my personality, self-awareness and adaptability will take me very far in this game. I'm also a go-getter and NO ONE wants this more than me. To me, this is not only a game…this is purpose. I've been preparing for this game for awhile, and I'm not leaving without a prize.[1]

3 Words to Describe You: Multi-faceted, exuberant, innovative
Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? I want to be part of SURVIVOR to win the game I know and love and prove that age does not define success. As someone who has obsessively studied the evolution of game theory within SURVIVOR, I cannot wait to test myself and see how my unique thought process and strategic background fare on a game built upon the idea of adaptability. While I believe that winning SURVIVOR requires some luck, I think that my intuition and discernment will lead me down a path to victory.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Over the last year, I have completed two semesters' worth of workforce development training at NASA. My first semester specialized in proposal writing, and my second dealt with mission concept design. I was the project manager of a team of 10 students. Working with a variety of people from all over the country to develop a formal engineering report was a challenge.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify most with Christian Hubicki. Christian embraced his quirks and nerdiness to disarm his opponents into wanting to work with him. He used his charm and intelligence as a weapon, and despite being labeled as the ""weakest"" male on the David tribe initially, he became one of the biggest threats after the merge. I intend to model my game after him but focus more on diminishing my threat level until the endgame. Unlike Christian, I do not plan to reveal my engineering background (especially given the perceptions attached to rocket science). I want people to solely view me in a ""Mr. Nice Guy"" light and I plan to ensure no one will detect my deeply strategic underside.
What will you value in an alliance partner? The quality I value most in an alliance partner is loyalty. I would love to be in on an alliance with someone who, no matter what, would never vote me out. Though personally, I am willing to do anything and work with anyone if it puts me in a better position to win this game.
Favorite Hobbies: 3D printing, Settlers of Catan, photography, Minecraft, strategic board games, space/engineering YouTube videos, Civilization V
Pet Peeves: Mosquitoes, delayed texters, people who text me essays, people who play on their phone during a movie, smacking gum in a silent room, people who radiate negative vibes, people who think the moon landing is fake.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I am most proud of being the recipient of the National Student Volunteer Award for 2022 in Consult Your Community, a nonprofit consulting organization that spans 26 college chapters. After working my way up to being president of the Georgia Tech chapter, I was beyond honored to find out about how many of my peers nominated me for the award.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? Most people would never know that I 3D print and design SURVIVOR puzzles for fun. Part of my preparation for SURVIVOR has been practicing the 3D puzzles I've made.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My great-grandfather is my biggest inspiration in my life. Growing up in poverty and working his way up to being a chief engineer at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, my great-grandfather was able to help shape NASA projects such as Skylab and Saturn V during the peak of the space exploration era.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I will be the Sole Survivor because of my natural ability to push myself to succeed. No matter what challenge I am presented with, I never give up and always prepare to the best of my ability. I plan to use my emotional intelligence, logical mind and kindness to bring home the million-dollar check and become the youngest SURVIVOR winner in the process.[1]

3 Words to Describe You: Passionate, a little bit loud, open
Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? I want to share my story. I want to bring the hope. Addiction looks different for everybody and recovery does too. SURVIVOR is so much more than a game to me. It's the human interactions, the growth and the fun! Of course, I want to be a part of that!
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Overcoming my addiction and learning how to forgive, love and accept myself. Active addiction is mental and emotional torture. It took me years to realize my mistakes don't define me. I've worked hard to become this person I am proud of. I know this game will break me down but I am strong, resilient and most importantly I believe in myself!
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I so badly want to be like, ""Yeah, I'm going to be as strategic as [Kelley] Wentworth and cutthroat like Parvati."" But that isn't happening because I am way more Noura. My entire life I've been told that I'm too this, I'm too that, I'm too loud…too much. It has been my dream to play this game as myself and Maryanne is proof it can be done. I want to have fun like Tiffany, be lovable like Maryanne, and free-spirited and spontaneous like Noura.
What will you value in an alliance partner? I know this is a game but we are human first. My alliances will go deeper than strategy because my bonds will be real. I value authentic connections and interactions. My alliance goal would be something like the beautiful bond between Shan and Liana, or the partnership of Christian and Gabby (pre-merge though).
Favorite Hobbies: Gardening, ice skating, rescuing bunnies
Pet Peeves: When people ask me if I'm sick if I'm not wearing makeup. People who make fun of what is different from them or what they don't understand. Gel polish that chips quickly.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Staying sober for the last 13 years and raising my son in recovery.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I eat so much candy, it's ridiculous. I've had three crowns because I keep cracking my teeth from jawbreakers and atomic fireballs. I've fallen asleep eating chocolate too many times to count.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My mom and dad. My mom is the most selfless person I know. She's my rock and never hesitates to help, even when her own needs are pushed aside. My dad dropped out of school and joined the circus. He decided to turn his life around so he went back to school, got a law degree and was elected into the Senate. He believed in me when I didn't believe in me and pushed me to do better no matter what my past looked like.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? Because my authentic connections will win me the game![2]

Why do you want to be part of SURVIVOR? This is the dream! I also want to continue representing the Latinx and Latinas out there (just like some pioneers have done in the past) and hoping some new people get inspired to go after their dreams.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I am a first generation in the States. I moved with nothing and barely able to speak the language. I had to learn and adapt all by myself to succeed in this country.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I absolutely love Sandra. I am from Puerto Rico and if I can be half as good as her that means I will win once (although I want to compete in the challenges!). After re-watching seasons, I truly like Angelina. She is seen as a ""villainess"" but I love her female empowerment and her negotiations have changed the game.
What will you value in an alliance partner? Strategic collaboration and encouragement from each other when we get to the ""lows."" Honesty is also important but I know this game well enough to know that honesty is very hard to achieve in this game.
Favorite Hobbies: CrossFit and playing board games
Pet Peeves: Rude people (it is always ""nice to be nice""!)
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Beyond my family (which is the best part of my life), I am proud of a few things. I am proud how far I have taken my career. I am proud of all the patents I have. I am proud of all the marathons I have done.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? That I played for the national youth basketball team (12 years old and I was the captain). Or maybe that I have over 40 patents filed.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My mother! She does not care too much about material things. She loves a simple life and always reminds me to respect people no matter the circumstances.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I am in it to win it. I want to represent those people that may sound different, may look different. We do not have many role models out there, so I would love to win and be a role model for others. And of course, the money would be life changing.[2]

And I want to prove to me, that I have the physical & mental strength to make my dreams come true, and to win the title & money.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, we had no power in my house or work for 90 days. And I had to lead my team of 20+ adults (most older than me) and give them hope, when I felt I had none. Without them I would not be who I am today.

Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I wake up every day wishing I was Mike White.

Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I want it more. Nobody wants this as bad as I do. I feel like Charlie — I got the golden ticket, I'm at the chocolate factory, and I plan on being the last one standing. Game on.[2]

Why do you want to be part of Survivor? I have been watching Survivor ever since the very beginning. I always wanted to play, but for so many years never had the confidence to even put myself out there. For me, Survivor represents my chance to reclaim a lot of lost time and missed opportunities. Now that I have pride and confidence in myself, I am ready to play and win!
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? As a gay man, overcoming social stigma and religious expectations helped me to develop mental grit, tenacity, and resilience, which is absolutely necessary for Survivor.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify the most with Zeke Smith. He was always authentic and true to himself. He always came across as genuine, even in his gameplay. I imagine I will play the most like Cirie Fields and Todd Herzog. They both were able to use the power of connection and social wit to form relationships that brought them further into the game. Then, when those relationships no longer served their game play, they voted them out. I know that sounds harsh, but that's the game! We can be friends after I win, I promise.
What will you value in an alliance partner? Something I really value in my everyday life as an elementary school principal is diverse perspectives. I am going to bring that value into the game. I want to align with people who think differently than me because they will be able to see situations from a different vantage point, suss out shady people, or have different ideas that I may not initially see, notice or have.
Favorite Hobbies: My husband, Matt, is a great cook. My favorite thing to do is eat his food while spending quality time with him and watching Survivor seasons. I also love a good game night with my cousins.
Pet Peeves: People who are arrogant and think they are better than others.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I am pretty proud of a lot of things, like being the first openly gay school principal in my school district, getting my doctorate degree, having my work published in various academic journals, but all of that pales in comparison to my absolute greatest success in life which is marrying my husband, Matt.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? When people first meet me, they often make assumptions. Almost everyone thinks I am younger than I really am. There was a time in my life when I was a high school vice principal and parents and visitors thought I was the student body president. So, people are always surprised to learn that I am so accomplished in my education and career. I'm not just here for a good time, I am goal driven and a natural leader.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My older sister, Elaine, has autism. She is nonverbal, aggressive, and self-injurious, and cannot live independently. Although she faces more challenges every day than most other people, she smiles, laughs, and gets through it. I hope to one day have an ounce of her bravery.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? Survivor is largely a social game and my skills in this area will lead me to becoming the next Sole Survivor. I can read people's emotions, empathize with others, connect with anyone, and make people feel comfortable with me. These skills will help me to build alliances naturally and easily. I'm ready to claim the $1 million now.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Curious, clever, motivated.
Why do you want to be part of Survivor? Playing Survivor has been a dream of mine since I was 10 and watched Nicaragua with my parents. Growing up as a mixed Asian kid, I never thought I would be ""Asian"" enough or ""white"" enough to play the game I love. I'm here to prove that kid wrong and hopefully inspire others to do the same.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? When I was 16, I weighed almost 200 pounds and struggled with self-confidence issues. I realized that my situation wouldn't get any better if I didn't do anything about it, so I started running three miles every night. Within a year, I became much more confident and 50 lbs lighter.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify the most with David Wright, who helped inspire me to put myself out there and push my limits when I struggled with my weight. I think I will play the most like Yau-Man — a strategic, innovative and friendly game (although I don't plan on giving away any trucks).
What will you value in an alliance partner? Someone who can pick up the pieces I miss. This could be physical challenge strength or connections with people. Also if they are someone I would be proud of as a winner. In the era of betrayals (Ricard/Shan, Jesse/Cody), I think this is important.
Favorite Hobbies: Running, disc golf, baseball, and Pokémon Go. Oh, also puns, especially when they get a good groan out of everyone. 
Pet Peeves: When someone takes the urinal directly next to you, despite plenty of others being open.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? In 2021, I wrote, illustrated, and published my own children's book! I have always had a passion for writing, and this helped me put this passion to the test.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I am a massive baseball fan. Growing up, I was an all-star pitcher and avid Ichiro supporter. The Mariners are still my favorite team, and I spend countless hours watching and discussing baseball with my family. I also don't eat sushi — probably my biggest sin as a half-Japanese man.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My grandpa, Tom. He's a 94-year-old beast that helped spur my love for baseball and also loves to garden. He grew up in Japanese internment camps, and always reminds me to keep pushing my hardest. He also still has a full head of hair.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I will be the sole Survivor because my combination of quick thinking and acute attention to detail will make sure nothing gets by me.[1]

3 Words to Describe You: Ambitious, optimistic, creative.
Why do you want to be part of Survivor? Growing up as a kid who always had her head in an adventure novel, I've always dreamed of getting to embark on an epic quest of my own someday. The first time I watched Survivor, I knew that this was the quest I had been waiting for. I've always looked up to the people who played this game — they're risk takers, strong leaders who think on their feel and adapt quickly to obstacles; they embody the qualities I strive to have in my life. Having the opportunity to play this game is not one I take lightly, they say this game changes and challenges you, and I am ready to be challenged.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? A couple of years ago, I took the biggest risk of my life — I turned down early admission to Harvard Law school in order to pursue a career as a singer/songwriter. My entire life I'd been preparing for a legal career because up to that point I felt that's what was expected of me. I faced pressure from my family and community to follow a certain path, and it wasn't until a couple of years ago I realized I was running out of time to live life on my own terms. Moving to LA and trying to start a music career felt a lot like starting over — I was coming into this cutthroat industry with no experience, and I had to learn the ropes extremely quickly. That experience reminds me a lot of what my fellow castaways and I will do.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Queen Parvati has always been such a role model of mine, and I think I can relate with her in a few ways. Not only are we both named after powerful Hindu goddesses, but I can resonate with how people have underestimated her strength and strategic skill because of her bubbly personality. In a similar vein, I adore Maryanne's game, how she lay low and let people discount her as a threat until the end, when she revealed herself to be a strategic mastermind with an almost mathematically methodical understanding of the game's dynamics. I'll be aiming for a similar position early on the game — not running away from my loud personality and shrouding my observations of other players until the right moment.
What will you value in an alliance partner? I would love to work with the people I most naturally get along with, people who I can strongly relate to. I feel like the easier it is for me to get to know someone, the easier it will be to read them for signs of agreement or deceit. It's also important to me that my allies are comfortable following the natural ebb and flow of the game; not playing too hard when you don't have to but still being capable of bold moves when the time calls for it.
Favorite Hobbies: Reading (favorite genres: fantasy, science fiction and romance), running, playing pick-up soccer, crossword puzzling, and punning.
Pet Peeves: Slow walkers (only if they take up the entire sidewalk) 
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Being able to build a career for myself in the mainstream music industry as an Indian-American woman and as an independent artist. I came into music starting truly from scratch, knowing nobody and having no understanding of how anything worked and through a lot of hard work, I can now say that millions of people around the world listen to my music, and that my music has been praised by organizations like the Recording Academy! Above all, representation means everything to me — nothing makes my day more than receiving comments and messages from other South Asians saying they've been encouraged by my decision to pursue a career in the arts to do the same — it's what makes me the proudest. I know how truly fortunate I am to be able to do what I love and I am so grateful I made the decision to follow my dreams.  
What is something we would never know from looking at you? You probably wouldn't be able to tell I'm the youngest international pun championships award winner in history!
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My grandmother, my Paatti. When she was 16, she climbed Mt. Kanchenjunga with Tenzing Norgay (one of the first people to summit Mr. Everest), becoming the first South Indian woman in history to do so. For her bravery, she was awarded the ice axe medal by the Indian government. While the achievement itself is extraordinary, her unwillingness to accept constraints others placed on her is what truly inspires me.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I'm adaptable. I've operated in many different spheres in my life — competitive punning, debate, the music industry — the same way: first observing quietly and then fitting myself into the gaps to carve out my own space. I feel like I've been preparing for Survivor my whole life, and I think I have a little more strength in me than I like to let on.[1]

Why do you want to be part of Survivor? I want to test myself mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I also want to have a massive impact on the world with all the programs and outreach I do, whether it's for kids I work with, for autism or my mentorship program helping underprivileged kids.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Being a martial artist my whole life. [I] started Yang-style tai chi when I was six. It's taught me so much about mental toughness.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Tony V. I like the ferocity he played with and his reason — to help his family grow and be sustainable. Him and I are equally as crazy!!

What is something we would never know from looking at you? I love Dragonball Z!
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My father. He was brave enough to fight for our country in the Vietnam war. He taught me Tai Chi.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? Because I will be undeniably myself. I will be unwavering in my pursuit. I am willing to suffer, I am willing to do whatever it takes. I am the Sole Survivor.[2]

Why do you want to be part of Survivor? I remember laughing with my mom at the pathetic, crying Survivors on TV. She'd always say she couldn't wait to watch me out there, so it'll be meaningful to close that chapter. Also, $1 million USD goes even further in Canada.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Lifeguarding at 17 to start a painting business. I ran this business throughout university to pay for school. I've been failing lots all my life, but I have the life and street skills to bring to Survivor.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I'd love to say Tony, but out of respect I won't.
What will you value in an alliance partner? Someone who can control their emotions and who has relationships and can gather information from other members of the tribe, so we can build the most complete picture possible.
Favorite Hobbies: Basketball, travel, trying things for the first time, friend-related activities, trouble.
Pet Peeves: People with no sense of humor. People who talk about wanting things but won't do anything about it.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I work for a marketing company that partners with businesses to educate their communities about choosing conservative healthcare (physical therapy, chiro, etc) over addictive medication and invasive surgery. It's a mission I'm passionate about. Over the past five-plus years I've generated [millions] in sales, which means I'm helping thousands of patients and hundreds of local businesses.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I've worked remotely since 2017 and have lived in 27 countries. Fiji is 28.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My dad, who never graduated high school and was in jail five years (one and a half in Ethiopia, three and a half in Somalia), yet has a degree from Russia, along with his nursing degree. My parents have sacrificed a lot for their kids to have opportunities to do better and experience more, which pushes me every day.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I've never been qualified for anything I've done, so why not me? Whether getting my first job at 13 [by] lying and saying I was 16, to slinging pizzas, starting a painting biz having never picked up a brush, or working in software sales, I've never had the ""resume"" but I always figure it out and bring my entire personality, and I expect the best in Survivor.[1]

Age: 30
Hometown: Weston, CT
Current Residence: New York, NY
Occupation: Critical Care Nurse
3 Words to Describe You: Scrappy, deliberate, intuitive.
Why do you want to be part of Survivor? I started watching the show while working through the COVID pandemic as a nurse in NYC. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done, but it taught me that life is short and can change overnight. So why not go for what you want full tilt? I think that spirit of perseverance and true humanity is woven throughout this game. Plus, I love the adventure [and] competition — and who doesn't want to run extreme adult obstacle courses?
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Definitely being a nurse. I became an EMT at 18. I've worked in the emergency room, now in critical care, and through COVID as a nurse in NYC. These experiences taught me to be rational, perceptive and emotionally intelligent in sustained stress and chaos. Not to mention, doing this on a night shift for 12 hours at a time, often without a break to rest! Nurses are tough — but we're also empathetic, comforting, and vulnerable. That combination will help me greatly in the game.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I totally relate to Kelley Wentworth's tenacious, scrappy vibe. But I think like Parvati, I have the ability to connect with and draw in lots of different types of people with charm and authenticity but still maintain an independent ruthless mental strategy. I'd also like to draw inspiration from Cirie, as we are both nurses!
What will you value in an alliance partner? I'd like to play with people that I not only trust but also understand their motives. They don't have to be traditionally predictable — I just have to ""get"" them and vibe with them! And hopefully we can have some fun together!
Favorite Hobbies: Playing acoustic guitar, watching/playing soccer, and taking board games way too seriously.
Pet Peeves: Inefficiency and know it alls.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Working through the COVID-19 pandemic as a nurse in NYC — it showed me I have a lot more resilience and grit than I thought! I'm also proud of being my nursing school valedictorian and getting into Yale for grad school. I think people really underestimate nurses' intelligence, but I live to prove people wrong!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I am a little nerdy. I love strategy board games and video games.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My fiancé, Gabrielle. She has persevered through difficult times against the odds and became not only successful but through everything, been the most genuine, generous, empathetic, individual who brings everyone together.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? My job requires me to be adaptable in the face of constant chaos and change, just like this game! I'm a chameleon, I can bro out with jocks, nerd out with nerds, be besties with the girls. There's no one I can't bond with! I think I will surprise people. At the end of the day, I'm fully prepared to manipulate and blindside my way to final tribal, where I can get votes from my friends on the jury.[1]

What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Walking the Camino Primitivo in Spain by myself definitely prepared me for this game! Walking alone over 15 miles in a day in a new country with nothing but my backpack showed me how determined and resourceful I am.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I see bits of myself in a lot of strong female players, like Amanda, Michele, and Kim. But the first player I really connected with is Carolyn from season 44! Like her, I am not afraid to be myself and let my freak flag fly. I love her authenticity and hope to bring that into the game myself.
What will you value in an alliance partner? Loyalty! I would love to find two people to go all the way to the end with! Also, I will definitely value someone who is relaxed and grounded to help balance me out!
Favorite Hobbies: Hiking, roller blading, studying astrology, reading, camping, cooking for friends, listening to music.
Pet Peeves: People who chew with their mouths open, snoring, not saying please and thank you, and when people ask me the meaning of my tattoos.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Completing the Camino de Santiago!
What is something we would never know from looking at you? That I talk exactly like Drew Barrymore.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? It's hard to pick just one person because all of my friends inspire me so much and in so many different ways!

Why do you want to be part of Survivor? The first season of Survivor that I ever saw was in 2015 — Cambodia: Second Chance. I was 40 years old, recently a single mom with two middle-school children, and I had just started law school. I watched Survivors get a second chance at the game. The whole game felt like my second chance of surviving life — I was hooked. Survivor still inspires me to take risks and win at life. Why would I not want to be a part of being on this amazing show?
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Starting over at age 40 — being a single mom of two pre-teens, teaching art classes during the day and going to law school at night. Creating a new life for myself and my kids. I passed the bar exam and graduated law school within a week of my daughter graduating high school. Not giving up, building relationships, taking risks — all have prepared me for the game.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I most identify with Cirie. She got off the couch. She took a risk and played the game.

What is something we would never know from looking at you? I hope I don't look as old as I am or that [you can tell] I have a 23-year-old daughter and a 21-year-old son. I hope the other players cannot tell that I am attorney!
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My mom. When I was in the divorce attorney's office at 39 and called my mom to tell her I was going to be an attorney, she replied with, ""Yes, you are."" Just like that — no questions — only confidence. She went back nursing school when she was 45 and is still a research nurse at 78. My mom challenges ""the norm"" and inspires me to say ""yes"" to challenges.
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I read people well — I have good instincts and will carry my family's support with me in the game. I want to win it to inspire and motivate other women in their 40s and older; it's never too late to start something new or go after a dream. I want to inspire them to be their own hero.[2]

What will you value in an alliance partner? Loyalty so unrelenting that it's illogical. (Think Laurel's loyalty to Wendell.)
Favorite Hobbies: Hot yoga, eating delicious food in gorgeous locations, and countering systemic racism.
Pet Peeves: Slow walkers, slow talkers, and people who ooze privilege.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Successfully switching my life from just ""surviving"" to actually ""thriving.""
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I speak French. Oh, and I'm almost color blind.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? Katurah, the child. That little girl faced some of the most unimaginable obstacles, yet still decided to protect herself, become a civil rights lawyer, and break generational curses, and she grew up and did exactly that!
Why will you be the Sole Survivor: Because I've been preparing for it for life (even when I didn't realize it)![2]

Occupation: Attorney
3 Words to Describe You: Boisterous, wily, persistent.
Why do you want to be part of Survivor? Survivor is a celebration of everything I've been able to accomplish in my life. I graduated law school while working two jobs, and I forged a healthier lifestyle, losing 80 lbs. in the process.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I feel studying for the bar exam prepared me for Survivor. It takes a lot of dedication, self-control, and enduring some tough days but if one respects it, one can meet the challenge.
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Wendell, because we both have a logical side, both going to law school, but we are also creatives. I think that combo served him well in the game.
What will you value in an alliance partner? I want an alliance partner that can cover my weakness and get tight with the people who keep me at arm's length. I need their trust and for them to believe what I say whether it's true or not.
Favorite Hobbies: Theater, Dungeons and Dragons, working out.
Pet Peeves: Motorcycles, people who take themselves too seriously, and people who won't hear out new ideas.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Finishing a Spartan race was a big moment for me, being a guy who used to start breathing heavy after two flights of stairs.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I make the best homemade pizza.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? Honest answer: My mom — without her support and her teaching me my work ethic, I wouldn't be where I am today.  
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I will be the Sole Survivor because no one wants it more than me and no one is going to work harder than me to achieve it. I'm a people person with the intelligence to use my social skills to navigate through the game.[2]

3 Words to Describe You: Ambitious, sweet, clumsy. 
Why do you want to be part of Survivor? Because I'm confident I can win it, and $1 million would really help with my six-figure student debt! I also love the game and am a competitor through and through. I want to duke it out with people when everything is on the line, and I want to prove to myself that I have what it takes. 
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? As a kid, I was a shell of my current self. I was shy and quiet, had terrible acne for a dozen years, wore braces from elementary school until high school (head gear included), had mild Tourette's, and was extremely self-conscious. I worked hard for years to build myself up and lived the entire introversion-extroversion spectrum. I feel like that experience made me a much more empathetic person. 
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify most with Owen Knight — long-hair, Asian, love the outdoors, never-say-die attitude. I think I'll play most like Jay and Wendell. Their games revolved around forming genuine connections that led people to keep them in the game, even when they were huge threats. On top of that, I have the intelligence to make big strategic plays as well as the physicality to win clutch immunities. Also, like them both, I too have a crush on Michele. 
What will you value in an alliance partner? Laughter is the key to my heart, so if someone is fun to hang with and laughs with me, we're gonna be best buddies.  
Favorite Hobbies: Backpacking somewhere new with my camera, hockey, volleyball…anything really that gets me active outside with friends! 
Pet Peeves: Any form of waste — wasted time, money, opportunity, food. Also, banana-flavored candy. But I still eat them. Cuz no wasting.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Making it onto the All-American team at the volleyball Junior Olympics when I was 15. That was my first major personal accomplishment, and it gave me the confidence I needed to start the personal growth journey to get to where I am today.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I own the (heavily contested and very impressive) world record for ""the most nuts thrown and caught in a can on the head in one minute."" The original record was 37, and I got 93.
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? Aside from my parents, maybe Naruto. That ninja never gives up no matter the obstacle. When I need to dig deep during some of the willpower challenges, I'll be channeling that Naruto energy. I'm going to be Sole Survivor. Believe it!
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? I make the best of every situation and I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm adaptable, creative, and have the tools to pull off an individual immunity run. I work my butt off, and I'll make sure not a second is wasted out on the island.[1]

3 Words to Describe You: Fiery, wildly enthusiastic, empathetic.
Why do you want to be part of Survivor? I can't just give one answer. First and foremost, I want my family to be set. My parents left their familiarity behind in Cuba so that I can fulfill my dreams. Secondly, I want to live a rare life surrounded by rare individuals and I can't do that unless I place myself in situations where I don't belong — like here. Finally, I want that immigrant kid watching the show to know that the mind is powerful beyond measure. You can do more than you think you can.
What's one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Starting my business at 23. I've learned how to turn an idea into reality, how to navigate hardships when finances were uncertain, and how to become a better business partner. This will help me in the strategic/social aspect of the game. 
Which previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify the most with Jesse. His why and my why are the exact same: Family above all else. I feel like I will play the game like Tony. Dude was a lot of fun to watch and was the ultimate persuader.
What will you value in an alliance partner? Someone who sticks to their word. In a game where deceit is inevitable, staying true to their word will get us further along. No one gets to the end by themselves anyway. Also, someone who is having fun! We're all stuck together on an island, why not have fun??
Favorite Hobbies: CrossFit (don't judge), running, traveling, anything outdoors, spending time with fam, anything that gets my heart racing.
Pet Peeves: Bad tippers, road ragers, constantly being late, [and] injustice to kids, old people or dogs.
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Running and completing my first full marathon when, prior to signing up, I had only ever run three miles. 26.3 miles scared the s--- out of me, so I put it on my calendar and figured out the ""how"" along the way.
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I am not a college graduate. Five years later and my fam still thinks I have my Bachelors. Whoops! Technically, in my head, I did graduate because I shook the [school] president's hand. Six months into waiting for my diploma, I found out I failed a class by one letter grade. Surprise, mom!
Who in your life is your biggest inspiration and why? My dad. He is my perfect example of not needing materialistic items to be happy. And I think I've only ever seen him mad three times!
Why will you be the Sole Survivor? It's already happened in my mind daily. I'm going to be the person out there who doesn't quit, and most importantly, the person who cares the most.[3]
